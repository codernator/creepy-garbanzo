-1 [`5Q`Pu``e`Ps`5T``] Hungry Hippo Quest (ImmQuest)~
Welcome to the first official `1V`!e`8l`!e`1s`` `5Q`Pu``e`Ps`5t``!  This particular `5Q`Pu``e`Ps`5t`` is
designed so that players of all levels will have a chance at winning, but
does allow for some killing and fun for everyone.  

The objective for the game is to collect as many hippo tokens as
possible.  You can kill anyone you want, you can use any skill/spell you
want (excluding acid rain and raze).  You are also prohibited from
bludgeoning/sleeping/webbing people and leaving them.  YOU MUST ATTACK
THEM!  

Now you may ask why you would bother killing other players in this
style quest.  Well because when you die you drop all your tokens! 
However for this quest the get all command will get disabled so you will
have to pick up each token individually. 
 
`!***`1NOTE TO IMMS`!***``
In order to disable get all you must use the commands
 
Immq getall 1 = disable
 
Immq getall 0 = enable

Whirlwind [Skill] Mercenary class only skill. 

Whirlwind allows the fighter to spin around as fast as they can while
wielding their weapons. 

This very aggressive attack hits everyone in the room, causing massive
damage to everyone within range. 

target in the room with you. 
 
The attack is draining and can fatigue the mercenary very quickly (-1000
move per attack).  There is also a chance that while attacking you will
become dizzy and fall to the ground.  This also happens if there is no
target in the room with you.

-1 ORACLE~

[`&O`7R`8AC`7L`&E`7]``

These good-hearted souls wander the world lending a hand to those that
are not fortunate enough to be able to help themselves. They are great
scholars and have an uncanny ability to win the admiration of others
through their generosity.

Although their primary role is that of helper, their aid does not always
come easily. Whenever a member of the guild is enlisted to aid someone,
he or she may decide to make the person "earn" their assistance through
a quest, or a riddle, or some other mental task.

Unlike the Merchants, these good folk do not work to gain wealth. Their
pursuits of treasure are oftentimes the means to the end of being able to
better serve others. Oracles serve many different gods and godesses. They
are not united by religion, but rather by their desire to improve the lot
of their fellow traveler.

Oracles do not engage in any sort of combat whatsoever or any aggressive
action against others. This includes lying about an item they are selling.
Oracles may however engage in contests of prowess in the battlefields.

The Oracles claim that greed rules the Merchants' lives and instead of
sharing the joys of life, they try to profit from them. They are,
plainly and simply, good-hearted helpers. Do not abuse their kindness.

To apply for Oracle, you must be an experienced adventurer with at least
75 seasons in the realm and be willing to work diligently for the cause
Oracles hold so dear.

`!You must display your sub_clan in your title at all times.``

[`7SAGE``]
The sages of Oracle are those men and women who will offer their advice to
any and all. They spend most of their time in their studies memorizing the
maps and legends of the land. If there is a question that you seek an answer
to, the Sages of Oracle are the people you seek.

[`&MENTOR``]
These strange men and women know that the only way for you to grow in your
training is to seek adventure. They are the ones that will enter into combat
with you and allow you to practice against enemies that are far superior to
yourself. They are not difficult to find in their road weary clothing and
their packs filled with healing salves. They know that their type of training
is not for everyone, but if you ask nicely enough, they may allow you to follow
them for a time.

[`8MAGI``]
These are the high priests, priestesses, and conjurers of Oracle. They spend
most of their time high up in the studies memorizing their cantrips and trying
to recapture lost spells. When they do come down, they are always willing to
cast healing and protective spells upon you. If you are lucky, they may even
test a new spell or scroll on an enemy creature for you.

-1 ARMADA~
`!PK ONLY``
[`^A```6R```&MA```6D```^A``]
Unlike the ancient `^A```6R```&MA```6D```^A`` of old, the `^A```6R```&MA```6D```^A`` which has evolved in modern times
does not consider all the other races their enemy. Inferior, yes, but enemies,
no. The dragons of `^A```6R```&MA```6D```^A`` with their long lives and their great strength look
more upon the other races as simple-minded children or pets who need to be
taken care of and shown their path. They believe that they were given their
great strength and stature in order to protect those weaker beings of the world;
basically everyone else.

`^A```6R```&MA```6D```^A`` believes that the "weaker" beings would be better off under their
protection and guidance and work toward that end to provide that guidance. That
guidance and protection, however, does not come without its circumstances. The
`^A```6R```&MA```6D```^A`` demands to be respected and feared. You do not have to cower at the
presence of an `^A```6R```&MA```6D```^A`` member, but when they speak, you better listen, obey,
understand they want to help you, or suffer the consequences, which vary
depending on the dragon's mood and color of course.

By followers and allies they are seen as a strong force and a powerful friend.
As enemies they are seen as fanatical, power hungry, and swift to judge.

Any non-clan dragon is automatically considered an enemy.

Anarchists particularly resent the dragons' attempts at benign, if presumptuous
rule over the rest of the world and try at every turn to undermine the dragons'
efforts to direct the other races in their "care" as it were.

are not the best clan members to seek help from, their fury against the

They will talk out any situation or problem that arrises before resulting

devout their lives to the gaining and teaching of knowledge.  They fight
when they must, applying their skills in fields other than weaponry most
of the time.  If you need help within the clan, you will most likely end
up receiving it from a Green.

-1 `^[`OC`4l``a`4n`OS`^]`` Blood_History~
This is the story behind {BLOOD}.  Few know it in full, and fewer still
will talk about it, however you have been chosen to learn the truth. 
Blood began relatively recently, sparked by an unlikely event and an even
more unlikely choice.  

Furey, the co-founder of {BLOOD} comes from a very long and prestigious
line of magic users, specifically witches and warlocks.  His parents both
maintained this profession; however they were heavily vested in the use
of the darkest of the dark arts.  They expected their son to follow in
their footsteps and pursue similar interests.  Furey did to an extent. 
He took up the study of a warlock, but he did not agree with his parents'
obsession with evilness.  He shunned their one sidedness.  He studied
spells and techniques that spanned the full range of demonic and angelic
sources. His parents were appalled and forbid him from practicing
anything but the dark Arcanum.  When Furey refused to follow their
commands it created a great rift in the family.  He was an embarrassment
to his parents.  They were so sickened by the thought of their son that
after many nights of debate they decided there was only one solution. 
Furey was to be murdered.  Strange though it may seem, Furey's parents
chose not to carry out the deed themselves.  

Instead they gave the task to their manservant, T'Nar.  

T'Nar was a large, twisted looking mutant from somewhere deep in the
jungle.  How he came to be a manservant to this particular family is
unknown, however he took great pride in his work, he also took great
pride in the work that the family did.  T'Nar was not just twisted in
appearance, whatever great physical torment his body was constantly under
had also twisted his mind.  He delighted in performing cruel acts upon
others.  Even his son, Talis, was no stranger to freakish games, beatings
and torture.  T'Nar's one goal in life was to serve the family, in return
the family made sure that T'Nar's voracious cruelty was well sated.  

Talis, sick of his father's constant beatings, was eager to free himself
from the torture.  He overheard his father one night talking to his
master, Furey's father.  They spoke of a quick death for their son, one
that not a soul would figure out.  They wanted the murder of their son to
look like nothing more than a disappearance.  Talis, though not fond of
Furey, had finally reached his breaking point and could not stand to see
is father put a single finger on another soul.  Filled with cool resolve,
Talis decided that it was his father who must go.  

The next night, T'Nar left his small shack right as the moon was
beginning to wane in the night sky.  He made his way from his small shack
toward the Avarra mansion, a place that he has served for so long.  He
knew right where Furey's bedroom was, making his quick and quiet entrance
a facile task.  T'Nar scaled the balcony leading to Furey's bedroom and
cracked open the balcony doors.  There lay Furey sleeping peacefully, his
only movement the gentle rise and fall of his chest.  T'Nar drew his
favorite weapon of murder, a crooked jagged blade he had fashioned
himself, and began to slowly walk toward Furey.  Looking down on the
human, the Mutant noticed a small scar across Furey's face.  He chuckled
slightly to himself envisioning the gash he was about to help emerge
across his victims throat.  As T'Nar gazed down onto Furey, proud of the
murder he was about to commit, Furey's eyes shot open.  The mutant stared
into the beautifully soft blue eyes, and hesitated for a second.  Furey
blinked, but it was too late and T'Nar quickly raised his arm to drive
his blade home.  As his arm reached its peak, a dull souding THWAP came
from behind him.  The mutant dropped to the floor unconscious, only to
reveal another mutant, T'Nar's son Talis.  Talis quickly explained to
Furey the motives behind the murder attempt.  Even as he processed the
new information, Furey rose out of bed and gathered his magical items and
some clothing.  He looked down at the unconscious mutant and then at his
savior. Talis nodded slightly and then roughly picked up his father's
unconscious form.  Dragging the limp figure towards the balcony Talis
could feel his father start to regain consciousness.  Leaning his father
over the railing, Talis quickly slit his throat.  Watching as his
father's life spilled down his hands and arms, he gave the soon to be
corpse a push over the railing and watched as it stopped with a dull
thud.  No amount of magic or natural regenerative abilities would allow
T'Nar to recover from such wounds.

Continued...

Furey, filled with rage at the betrayal of his parents, quietly motioned
for Talis to follow, and the two set forth down the hall.  As they crept
closer to the door, Furey could barely contain the rage bubbling inside. 
He passed through the door, found his parents, both of them lying in bed,
asleep. Without hesitation, Furey drew on his innate powers, the very
ones that his parents had instilled within him and began casting.  The
ease with which his spells ate away at their bodies was staggering.  The
parents, unaware of what was going on began to chant curative countering
spells. But their efforts were to no avail; instead they hoped that with
their dying breath they would also condemn their son to the same fate. 
Furey would allow no such thing and quickly sent mental energies toward
his mother and father.  So intense and brutal were Furey's attacks that
the whole encounter took only a few moments before his parent's bodies
lay lifeless in bed.  Furey, having spent his rage, shed a few silent
tears as he pulled their blanket over their faces.  Silently the two made
their exit from the mansion, once outside both looked back at had once
been their home.  Chanting quietly to himself, Furey sent a wave of fire
toward his family's mansion.  The two turned without watching as their
home quickly succumbed to the flames.  

In an old abandoned hut somewhere deep in the forest Talis and Furey
rested gathering their thoughts.  Furey spoke emotionally, "I can't
believe my own parents would try to do away with me in such a manner". 
Talis slowly looks at Furey nodding his head and responds, "We both have
slain our family and have no home left t..t..to g..g..go back to, but I
hold no g..g..grudge for th..th..the way l..l..life has treated
m..m..me.  We all must m..m..meet our ending someday.  "

With nowhere to go, and no one to turn too, Talis and Furey became
inseparable.  For much of their adolescence, they spent every minute
together, most of the time training both their minds and bodies.  Soon
they even developed a motto, "Be Loyal or Otherwise Die".  They both
swore undying loyalty to each other, as it was betrayal that had struck
their hearts the deepest.  

One night as Talis and Furey sat quietly by a fire, Talis motioned for
Furey to hold out his arm.  As Furey extended his arm, Talis drew a small
jagged dagger.  Talis, biting on the tip of his tongue in concentration
quickly and delicately began to carve into Furey's arm.  The cuts were
not deep, but blood trickled down Furey's arm.  Unable to see what was
being done to his skin Furey resigned himself to sit and wait until
Talis's artwork was complete.  Suddenly with a flourish Talis grabbed a
handful of charcoal dust, wiping away the blood Talis tossed the dust
onto Furey's arm.  Looking down at his arm and was finally able to see
that his skin was clearly marked with the word {BLOOD}.  Talis then took
up the dagger again and carved the same marking into his own forearm.  

Bonded forever by trust and loyalty, they fought side by side, while each
had his own interests and goals that would cause them to sometimes be
long distances apart both supported each other as best they could, their
loyalty to each other was beyond question.  The two swore oaths upon
their marked arms, they would forever look out for their own interests
and goals, and they would provide support to each other's endeavors. 
They would only side with the forces of light and dark if they felt the
need or the payment made it worth doing.  Their goal was to carve their
names and the name of {BLOOD} into the pages of history as not only
something to be remembered, but to be respected.

"Everyone knows the phenomenon of trying to hold your breath underwater -
how at first it's alright and you can handle it, and then as it gets
closer and closer to the time when you must breathe, how urgent the need
becomes, the lust and the hunger to breathe.  And then the panic sets in
when you begin to think that you won't be able to breathe - and finally,
when you take in air and the anxiety subsides...that's what it's like to
be a vampire and need blood.  "

`!History:`` For many the concept of feeding upon other sentient creatures
brings about disgust and horror, but for some races such as dragons
werebeasts and giants it is nothing more than a quick snack.  However
there is one race that brings the concept to a whole new level,
Vampires.  While their origin is unknown a few concrete facts are known
and a few more credible theories exist.  Vampires' natural form is that
of a Human or Aiel, no other race has had any record of Vampires.  All
Vampires must feed on other sentient creatures in order to survive and
thrive.  While feeding on animals will slack the thirst of all but the
most powerful Vampires it leaves a sense of dissatisfaction and emptiness
that is not present after feeding on a sentient creature.  

The cause of Vampirism is unknown, some believe that it is caused by a
virus that when a Human or Aiel is infected by it causes them to become
depended on a steady influx of blood in order to survive.  The virus is
said to not take hold of the infected person until after they have passed
away and their immune system is no longer functional.  The Virus then
reanimates the dead flesh and takes over the necessary functions for the
newly awakened dead.  

The other theory which is just as likely is that because of the physical
similarities between Garion Thalos and other Humans and Aiel that when
Garion cast his spell to cheat death his spell also had a secondary
affect on some people.  Instead of simply having a momentary lapse of
exhaustion, often referred to as "death," like most races, Humans and
Aiel sometimes stay dead for longer periods of time.  Vampires are a
result of Humans and Aiel that have spent longer in death than is normal
and as a result when Garion's spell takes hold they are no longer able to
carry on as strictly living beings.  Instead they are forced to exists as
both living and dead.  Unable to process normal food they are instead
forced to feed solely on blood in order to not starve to death.  

`!Mindset:`` Regardless of the cause one thing is certain, Vampires must feed
and the stronger the Vampire is or wishes to become the stronger the
victim must be.  This does not mean that all Vampires are evil, far from
it. Vampires retain their memories of when they were truly alive and for
some these memories are enough to keep their morals intact.  These
Vampires tend to feed only on those that deserve to be killed such as
thieves and murderers.  Other Vampires have taken on a different mindset
similar to one that many dragons and werebeasts share.  "These things are
my food, why should I treat them as my equal if they are nothing more
than my breakfast, lunch and dinner?  " Vampires with this mindset do not
care who they feed on instead they look for the strongest and freshest
creatures to feed upon.  

`!Social Structure:`` While there are a few different sects found in Vampire
culture there really has yet to be a unified body that has held domain
over the majority of Vampires.  Instead power has been taken by one sect
or another and infighting between Vampires of different sects and ideals
is commonplace.  A few of the more powerful sects are as follows:

`8The Sabbat:`` Strength is the key to the Sabbat's control over any of the
lesser sects.  Members of Sabbat pride themselves on feeding on the very
strongest of creatures.  They base their very existence on obtaining
power through direct conquest of other people.  It is common for the
tribes of Sabbat to surround a village for weeks at a time and just feed
until simply no one is left and then move on to feed again.  Because of
the mindset of the Sabbat the older a Sabbatian Vampire is the longer he
has had to feed and in turn have gained the most power.  Sabbatian
Vampires do not place a large stock in training, instead they seek power
through their victims.  

`1The Inconnu:`` Few vampires will actually admit to being Inconnu, but they
are by far one of the most powerful sects found within Vampire culture. 
They are the spiders that spread themselves out amongst the other sects
and tribes.  They wish to gain influence over others through deceit,
treachery and strategy.  By far the most intelligent of all the Vampire
sects they shun large scale combat in the name of their sect.  Instead
they prefer secluded one on one combat.  

`&The Anarchs:`` Young and brash this sect is an upstart to power and is
often looked down upon by older sects such as the Sabbat.  They represent
a strong dislike for tradition and power gained through age.  Instead
these individuals constantly train themselves to be at the peek of
physical perfection.  Their mindset is that they have been given natural
power, why waste it through constant scheming or lack of disuse.  Feeding
is nothing more than a way to supplement their abilities and it is done
without ritual or remorse.  Food is food after all.  

There are many other minor sects found in Vampire culture, however these
three previously mentioned are the three most powerful at this point in
time.

1 bot botting bots~
`!Rules on botting``

Botting on BT is illegal and will result in punishments placed on both
(all?  ) people involved with botting.  

The term botting is a lose term as are the rules on botting.  This means
if you fear that you may be botting you most likely are.  Anyone trying
too bend the rules will most likely receive a worst punishment.  


Botting on BT is determined as sending or receiving commands from another
playing in anyway.  

Or by running scripts that are time based/keyword specific (firing on the
word tic, bleeding, etc)

`@Examples of botting:``

Giving a player a spellup from them saying a command.  

Casting spells, or doing movement, combat or any other type of commands
that though triggers, macros or aliases sent from another player.  

Attacking several mobs, fleeing on a specific term like bleeding, going
too sleep and starting again after a tick and repeating is a prime
example of botting. 

`@Examples of not botting:``

A person asking for a spellup and `@you`` execute your own trigger/macro or
cast spells

You are in a group of other players and someone asks for you to heal them
and `@you`` execute the command/trigger/script too heal them.  


Other examples of botting (but not limited too this list) are the following:

Gold triggers that are fired over time, from ticks displayed or other
players.  

Triggers/scripts that automatically kills mobs and heals and repeats. 
Aka automated systems (pretty much scripting which is illegal as well)

it will announce it to you.  As of recently, it's been a trend for quest
gods to spam gecho.  This will now stop.  There's no way around it, it's
really REALLY annoying and unnessary for the OTHER half of the MUD *not*
in your quest.  Gecho will now be used for generic echos, (its purpose)
intro gechos when you login, exit gechos for when you leave, any aliases
you have setup for them that aren't too spammy... you can message, you can

`3History:``
`&--------``

"Waking or asleep,
Thou of death must deem
Things more true and deep
Than we mortals dream.
Else how could your thoughts
Flow in such a crystal stream?"
-Percy B. Shelley, Ancient Aiel Poet

Once, many years ago, a traveller named Dukkis came upon the beautiful
city of Babylon.  Dukkis had traveled all over Urth, but could not recall
having ever visited such a dazzling city.  Situated upon a vast oasis in
the middle of one of the cruelest deserts in the world, few had ever laid
eyes upon the glittering streets of silver, the fine purple and green
marble spires of the palace, the heavenly foods and...most of all...some
of the most beautiful women in all the world.  And, more beautiful than
them all was Queen Tenba, wife of King Netnehar.

Because visitors to Babylon were rare, Dukkis was brought to the palace.
He charmed the court with tales of his extensive travels, and was invited
to stay a fornight within the giant castle's walls.

For fourteen days, Dukkis continued to entertain the court, each night,
with his tales.  Each night, he racked his brain to come up with more
clever and amusing delights.  But, his tales were not merely meant to
amuse.  Dukkis had fallen in love with the Queen, and his heart would only
be nourished by her laughter and delight at his abilities.

On the last night, Dukkis told his greatest tales.  Long into the night,
the court was rapt with attention to his elaborate stories.  He finished
his performance by professing his love to Queen Tenba.

The King was outraged, but he knew he was bound by his promise of
hospitality.  At dawn, he bade his soldiers and his most powerful wizard
to escort Dukkis outside of the city gates.  The wizard then put a spell
upon Dukkis.  If he should ever travel over the city's borders, he would
instantly burst into flames, and die.

For months, Dukkis wandered the desert, love stricken.  He neglected to
eat, and one night found himself sleeping under a new moon, inches from
death.

Then, he heard a voice, an enchanting voice, somewhere between the waking
world and the world of eternal sleep.

It was the voice of Mala, the goddess of the desert, the goddess of
mirages, and the goddess...of Sleep.

Dukkis became the first worshipper of Mala, and for his devotion, Mala
showed him the way to return to his love.  She taught Dukkis the ancient
art of dream travel.  By travelling in this way, he would not have to
physically cross the borders of the city and could avoid the wizard's
curse.

Mala showed Dukkis how to kill the King of Babylon, but forewarned Dukkis
not to stay within the walls of the city for more than a year and a day.

And Dukkis did as Mala instructed, becoming King of Babylon by
assassinating King Netnehar.  He married the beautiful Tenba and ruled for
exactly one year.

Although Dukkis was loathe to leave the city, he and Tenba found the
clothes of nomads and fled the city one year afterwards.  And, it is a
good thing they did.  That night, a horror so terrible, so incredibly
unspeakable befell the city that not one person within its walls lived to
tell the tale.  By the end of the night, the entire city had sunk into the
sands.

No one has ever been able to find a single trace of its existance.

However, Tenba and Dukkis remained alive, and well, and from their union
the great Aiel race was born.

`3Homeland:``
`&---------``

The Aiel tend to live in places which require a hearty disposition.  Many
still live in the deserts, or in rocky mountain ranges.

However, almost all Aiel seek to return to Babylon.  Or, at least, the
elder Aiel do.  The younger Aiel have begun to disbelieve the legend, and
instead seek in their travels the -true- lineage of the Aiel.

`3Mindset:``
`&--------``

The Aiel are built for travelling and exploring, and are sought after
guides for any expedition.  They have even made treaties and ties to the
Mutant race, with whom they share a desert lineage.

Aiel are also deeply religious.  They worship Mala in ritual and deed,
honor Dukkis as their race's father.  The Priests of Mala describe their
Goddess as a woman clad in dark robes, living in the land between death
and life, between the sleeping and the awake.  She is both a teacher and a
warrior, beautiful and frightening.  She carries a pair of scissors made
entirely of the thoughts of children who have died in their sleep, and a
needle through the eye of which every grain of sand on Urth once passed on
its way from the heavens to the mortal realm.

The Aiel are extremely superstitious.

For instance, the believe that if you awaken and find a hair upon your
pillow, Mala has sent you a warning of a horrible fate which is to befall
yourself or your family.

If a young child sleeps through a terrible storm, the Aiel believe the
child has been chosen for Mala's priesthood.

If a female Aiel's veil is removed by the winds, she is destined to marry
the first man who looks upon her face.

`3Social Structures:``
`&------------------``

`&***``The Priesthood of Mala are, for the most part, the rulers of the
Aiel.  The priesthood is consulted on almost all matters...from disputes
between Aiel...to the naming of children.  Almost 1/5 of all Aiel serve
in the priesthood directly.  The Priests serve not only as lawmakers and
judges, but also as teachers and scholars, historians and philosophers.

`&***``The Dukkishari are a group of tale spinners who follow in the
tradition of Dukkis, travelling the world collecting the greatest stories.
Once a year, at the Festival of Tenba, a huge party celebrating Dukkis
winning over the heart of Tenba through tales, the Dukkishari compete.
Many Aiel attend, and many have found their future loves among the
storytellers at the Festival.

`&***``The Sandmen are among the most feared of all Aiel.  These warriors
and assassins have mastered Mala's domain, called The Sands.  Tales of the
Sandmen are told in almost all races to frighten children into going to
sleep...for if you linger awake in bed, the Sandmen may come and pull out
your eyeballs, placing them atop treebranches so they may watch all of the
Sands even when away.  The Sandmen often work directly or indirectly for
the priesthood, assassinating or torturing those who threaten the Aiel or
speak against Mala.  The code of the Sandmen prevents them from taking
money for their deeds, but gifts are allowed.

`&***``The Guild of Guides serves as a focal point for those travelling
parties looking for an experience Aiel guide.  By collecting money from
these guides-for-hire, the Guild raises enough gold to finance its own
expeditions, and its library contains some of the most expansive maps of
the lands of Urth.

-1 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` LOT3 (Inactive)~
`!- Can I buy things like poison to destroy someone else's land?``
Oh yeah.  Can you ever.  *evil grin*.  Since there's competition
for landowners to have the best land and produce the most grain,
fruit, or other items, sometimes landowners will resort to shady
tactics.  Remember, the owner with the most points when a stage
ends wins that stage and wins the prize.

`!- Do points reset at the end of a stage?``
Yes.

`!- Are lands ever taken back?``
Yes.  Lands can now be permanently destroyed.  Also if a landholder
deletes, etc, that property is lost forever.  And, if a owner is
not present for two consecutive rounds (two Sundays), that land is
then declared fallow and they must pay to regrow crop on that lot
the following Sunday.  Fallow lands do not accumulate points.

`!- What if someone hoardes properties?``
To put it eloquently, "Tough shit."  I make every effort to give
properties away fairly, so the only real way for someone to hoarde
properties is if someone chooses to sell them to that player.

`!- When are the rounds, again?``
Evangelion checks lots three times every Sunday.  This is for the people
with tight schedules who can't make it at a single time.  If for some reason
Evangelion can't make it, he'll post a note when that round will occur.
Usually if he can't make it, he'll span the round over 2 days (in other words,
he'll check 6 times).

`!- I don't understand something, or I think something is missing from
    this FAQ.  Who should I talk to?``
Evangelion.  Noone else, please--the other imms will have _no idea_ of
what you are talking about.
Thanks!

`OATM`` machines are located in various places on `5B`Pad`2T`@rip``. Their purpose is to make
your banking transactions easier and make your money more accessible. The ATM
in Midgaard is located S, E, U from recall.

Syntax for use:

`#deposit `7<`&amount`7> `#gold`` - deposits specified amount of gold into your account. If
`7  you wish to deposit silver, replace the word gold with silver.

`#withdraw `7<`&amount`7> `#gold`` - withdraws specified amount of gold from your account. If
`7  you wish to withdraw silver, replace the word gold with silver.

`#balance`` - this gives you your current balance of your account in gold and silver.

For each withdrawal and deposit, you are given a receipt. Once you've read this,
you can drop it and it will dissolve, keeping `5B`Pad`2T`@rip`` free of litter and the details
of your account private.

It is best to keep most of your cash in the bank, since when you are killed, approximately
half the amount you are carrying is dropped in a random spot in the mud, and it becomes
fair game for anyone who finds it.

-1 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` Weaponflags (NewbInfo)~
Weapon flags add attributes to your weapon and can make your weapon more
effective against mobs and players of different races.  Weapon flag
tokens may (in addition to adding attributes to a weapon) be used to
remove anti-good, anti-evil, anti-neutral, invis and bless flags.

Available flags are:

`#Flaming`7, `#frost`7, `#vampiric`7, `Osharp`7, `Ovorpal`7, `Otwo-handed`7, `#shocking`7, `#poison`7, & `Oacidic``.

In the list above, flags colored in `#yellow`` can be added by the blacksmith
of New Thalos (see '`#help blacksmith``' for more information).  The flags in
`Oblue`` can only be added by an immortal redeeming a weapon flag token. 

When an immortal redeems a weaponflag token, s/he can only put a total of
`&*`!2`&*`` flags on the weapon.  This means that if it already has flaming,
frost and shocking, and you want sharp added, s/he can put sharp and `&*`!1`&*``
of the other flags back on it.

If you are level 309 or less:
This command checks to see if the player has all 150 tokens needed.  It takes into account
how many of each type is needed, and if you don't have enough, it checks for wilds and takes
only what is needed to complete the 150 in the proper proportions.  Then it gives a message
the the imm and the mortal saying the tokens were taken and you can get/give the luvin now.
If the player lacks in any token type(s), the imm gets a message and the tokens are NOT taken
away.  While this was tested on the test port, please tstat before and after
each redeem to double check it for a while and note me if you find any problems.

If you are level 310 (Implementor):
This command checks to see if the player has 150 imp tokens.  If they do, it takes them
away and gives both the mort and the imp a message.  If they do not, it tells the imp and
takes nothing.

601 `&[`!R`8U`&L`8E`!S`&]`` OneOnOne (ImmStuff)~
Due to the lack of RP, I am now giving you, the leaders, the last tool you
should need to help develop your clans RP.  First of all, Know of help
20q, and if your clan doesn't have a requirements file, take a peek at
help solreq, help merc_req for requirement ideas.  Now, instead of just
doing notes to all, or rpnotes to all to help "herd in new RP" so to say,
this is the NEW way I suggest...

One on ones with the members, every single one you have, and every single
one that seeks you.  They have the files they need to get creative juices
going, they are either too lazy, or they aren't...  I want you to drag
these MUD tards into private convos with no one but yourself to examine
and ask about their RP, suggest ideas if they have none, ask them tons of
questions until they get ideas going, else they aren't RP material... it's
that simple.  Let's get some decent RP going, guys.  Not only is RP to all
important, and once you KNOW your characters.. interaction is GREAT.  But
right now people don't even know who they are, or what the clan is.

Hope this helps! :)

-1 `7[`5Q`Pu`7e`Ps`5T`7]`` Capture_The_Flag CTF (ImmQuest)~
CTF is a team oriented game.  The players are divided into teams, usually
by color but anything is possible (football teams, crazy words, whatever
works).  Each team is assigned to a Tower.  The immortal in charge of the
quest will flag your deathroom so that you repop in your tower when you
are killed.

The object of the game is to get your opponent's flag and make it back to
your tower with it, and have it placed into your team's chest, before the
other team does the same to you.

A few rules: (unless the immortal in charge specifically allows it)
1.  NO transportation spells, period.
2.  NO pushing ANY flag mob from where it was placed by the immortal.
3.  Stay loyal to your team at all times.
Anything else goes!

These rooms are usable only after a death, and greatly increase the
regeneration rate of the players inside it.  For even higher boosted
regen, rest or sleep on the couch provided in each room.  There are flags
of each tower color premade and ready to load.

After `!entering`` the "Tower" portal, each tower has a basic map written
into the room. "look map" to see it.  North is towards the top of the
screen on the map.

The maze itself has no loops or strange unrealistic twists, however, you may
expect it to change without notice.

602 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` PACKS_FOR_NEWBIES (ImmInfo)~
This is a new policy I don't want to see people slacking on.  It is a new
immortal duty, and if you don't feel like you can do it, let me know so
we can find an imm who can.

With that said here's what must be done.  Due to the overwhelming
onslaught of newbies, and their mixed reasons for being here, I am
entitling all immortals to give out the newbie packs I give to mortals
now.  I don't care if its an alt of someone, if they ask for the pack
nicely, give them one.  But if you see them delete, after dropping it for
their alt or some shit, then you can tell them that's bad.

I want you watch every newbie you see.  When they are created, goto them,
make them stand still for a bit.  Ask them these simple things.

1.  If they are new.  2.  If they are here to play and have fun or
anything else.. notes.. help files... causing drama.  If they say they
are here just to read notes, or help files, or cause shit (obviously),
and aren't here to play, force them to read help donating, and deny them
- note the imms with their site information.  3.  If they are new, and
are here to play.  great.  But I have seen a lot of people who aren't.
If you suspect someone is lying about wanting to play when you ask, snoop
them, watch them, if they are just reading notes and shit, they probably
aren't here to do that.  Use your best judgement in these times.  Ask
questions, try to communicatee, but if they are assholes, or don't
respond, just deny them and post a penalty about it.  Nothing elaborate,
I really don't care what they say if they say things about me (Coby) but
I do care if you feel the need to cut and paste that insult.  Like I
really need to read it, or something.  So don't do that, either.  A
general summarization is fine.  If they come back after you deny, permban
their site for newbies, and post that penalty too.

Doing this will make sure the newbies we allow on are actually here to
play, not to spy or stalk or talk shit.  And it will improve our
atmosphere, not to mention the opinion newbies have when then connect and
*bam* have an immortal there wanting to assist them / asking questions.
Thanks - Coby

-1 `&[`!R`8U`&L`8E`!S`&]`` General (NewbRules)~
These are the rules of Bad Trip.  For other matters, use common 
sense or ask an immortal. Ignorance of these rules will not be 
accepted as an excuse. 
   
`!*`` Your presence here is a privilege - not a right. Obey any orders from 
  gods and you will be fine. Deletion does not require a reason. Appeals
  are to be sent to the implementers (note to 'imp').
   
`!*`` Changes to these rules are at the discretion of the implementers, and
  may be done without warning, notice, or even evidence of sanity. It is
  your responsibility to keep your knowledge of the rules current at all
  times.
   
`!*`` Read all your changes and notes at all times. This is an enforced rule.
  All claims made in ignorance will now be punished to the full extent. The
  same goes for blatant disregard of any rule.
   
`!*`` Cheating will NOT be tolerated. This includes accepting favors from
  gods and exploiting bugs. If you find a bug, report it via a note to
  immortal, then do not use it.
 
`!*`` Since we allow cursing, discussions of an adult nature and other things
  that might make some people uncomfortable, grey areas will be dealt with
  fairly.
   
`!*`` Powerleveling is now illegal.  Immortals will be watching, and attempts 
  at powerleveling will be punished severely. 
   
`!*`` Sharing characters between players is not allowed. All characters are sole 
  property of the player who created them and may not be used by any other 
  player. 
   
`!*`` Advertising of any diversion beyond the game is not permitted. BadTrip will
  not be a bulletin board for other games. Anyone who arrives with the sole 
  intent to harvest players from BadTrip will find themselves most rudely and 
  promptly terminated. Those who choose to engage the game have made the choice 
  based on personal tastes, and will not be subjected to advertisements for 
  other MUDs, environments or products here.
  
`!*`` Quests are individual tasks and should be treated as such. Solutions to 
  riddles and locations of secret areas are exciting discoveries for every 
  player. Giving away items or information for the express reason of allowing 
  someone to solve a quest without working through it defeats the challenge 
  and deflates the accomplishment. Hints are acceptable, but direct answers 
  don't allow the quester to think for himself. Depriving other players of this
  enjoyment is simply not allowed.

`!*`` Play at your own risk; there will be no reimbursement of lost experience
  or items from crashes, lag, line-noise, dropped connections, etc. BadTrip
  mud is currently deep in development and although stable, it is still in
  testing.
   
See `!"`^help Combat`&|`^Social`&|`^Special`&|`^Respect`&|`^Clients`&|`^Clans`!"`` for additional rules.

-1 `7[`&Q`6u`7e`6s`&T`7]`` Immluvin (MortQuest)~
Any level `@609`7 Immortal may redeem what is known as a 'luvin'.  These are
special prizes you earn by collecting immortal tokens.  These will have `O2``
above average quest items and `O3`` above average tokens in them.  The best
part is that you get to pick and design the items yourself!

These luvins will cost `P150`` tokens.  The tokens must be applied as follows:

`250 quest tokens`7, `650 trivia tokens`7, `150 hidden tokens``.  `^Wild tokens`` may be
applied to satisfy any of the required token requirements.

You will be allowed to add extra affects to the base quest gear stats.
These stats stack `OON TOP OF`` the normal 200/200 10/10 -250.  The base
items to be loaded by the immortal are specially built items that have
set to the max legal stats for quest gear.

The bonuses are not stackable; once you add these points onto quest
piece, you may not add them again to the same item.  Each item also
includes a free `2restring`` of the piece, but remember to ask for it when
you get the luvin.

Implementors (`6610``) also have luvins available for 150 `6implementor
tokens``.  These are different from immortal tokens.  Implementor luvins
have set items and tokens in them and may not be customized according to
the above.

Read '`#help daigenluvin`7' '`#help peejluvin`7' and '`#help cobyluvin`7' for stats
on imp luvins

See '`#help luvinstats``' for information about building the gear.

0 `7[`&Q`6u`7e`6s`&T`7]`` luvinstats (MortQuest)~
You may choose any `&*`!1`&*`` of the luvin options below when redeeming your imm luvin.

`^Luvin Option 1:``

You may choose `O2`` wear slots.  The immortal will load special maxxed quest
items for those slots.  S/he will then add stats to the gear according to
the chart below.  You may add up to an extra of total of `@12`` points to
each of the two items.  Choose your stats from the options below:

-50 AC is `#1`` point.
-10 saves is `#3`` points.
+15 hitroll is `#3`` points.
+15 damroll is `#3`` points.
+250 hitpoints is `#2`` points.
+250 mana is `#2`` points.
+250 move is `#2`` points.

tokens may be applied (max of 1 per item) for a total of `@24`` points on any
one item.

With these items you also receive any `O6`` of the tokens below:

A token worth 1 Perfect gem.  (help inlay for info) (`!MAX 2 PER LUVIN``)
A token worth 15 trains.
A token worth 2 skills (that the character has ALREADY gained) set to 100%.
A token worth 25 potions of godliness.
A token worth 1 ring of protection fireproofed, 200/200'd, -250AC, 10/10 H/D.
A token worth 23 restrings (a full set of gear normally, unless mutant or human)

`!(The following options may be redeemed by a level `@308 `!Immortal)``

`^Luvin Option 2:``

`#15,000`` quest points (`P40,000`` quest points for an imp luvin).

`^Luvin Option 3:``

Same as Option One only instead of EQ you get to pick any `O8`` tokens.  With
a maximum of up to `!3`` Perfect gems!

`!One last note to immortals:`` Follow these guidelines exactly.  Ask an imp
if you have any questions about this.

-1 `&[`!R`8U`&L`8E`!S`&]`` Cln_Expectations~
Clan Expectations:
Okay, so you've gotten into a Clan, and you're wondering what
we expect you to do, or you're seeking one, and you want to know
what we'll expect you to do once you're in...

1.  We expect to see you on.  If we don't ever see you on, how can
    we possibly know you're RPing and playing?  You don't have to
    go out of your way to be on when an immortal clanleader is on,
    but there are mort leaders and other clanned players.  They'll
    know if they've ever seen you on.

2.  You HAVE to RP.  And it needs to be clan related, at least to a
    point.  RP on Gossip channel and face to face is wonderful, but
    you need to post RPnotes, too.  We can't know that you're RPing
    if we never see you do it.

3.  You may spar with your clanmates, if you both agree to it.  This
    is a great way to improve your PKing skills.  You will both be
    expected to post RP regarding the spar, and it would be great if
    you have a third party handy to give pointers.  You can also
    spar in battlefields if an imm will open one, or outside the field.

4.  Have fun!  Support each other, and do your best to uphold what your Clan
    stands for.  Note your clan if you are having problems in the game or if
    you're going to be gone of an extended period of time.  Being in a clan is
    a privilege, not a right, and with that privilege comes responsibility.
    Remember that newbies look up to you, and other players will want to RP
    with you if you demonstrate an ability to be a good sport IC and OOC.
    Remember that this is just a game, and Real Life comes first.  We're all
    here to have fun, so don't do something to someone else that would hurt
    your feelings/piss you off if it was done to you.

-1 `^[`#I-!n`#F`!O`^]`` 20Questions (RolePlayClanInfo)] RP rp ~
Players should try to consider the following questions while creating a new
character in this or any campaign world. The answers that one comes up with
will go a long way into defining the character as a person that is more than
the collective sum of his ability statistics.

After all other parts of character generation are completed, sit down and
answer the questions one at a time, considering their impact on the way the
character will behave and view the world. When you've finished you will have
created a true character, ready for play.

1. Who were the character's parents? Did they raise the character? If not,
why? If not them, who?

2. Did the character have any childhood friends? Any siblings? Where are
they now? Does the character stay in touch with them or have they become
separated? If separated, why?

3. What was childhood like for the character? Calm and peaceful or turbulent
and traumatic?  (And despite what you people seem to think, not everyone had
a horrible childhood.)

4. Does the character have any or did the character have any role models?
Describe them.

5. What did the character do before he/she entered the story? Who trained
the character to do what she/he does now? What is the character's
relationship with his teacher(s)?  (This is great for one rp note or
two...but we don't want to read your characters past history in
novels...we'd read books if we did.  *wink*)

6. What are the character's moral, ethical and religious beliefs? What
lengths will the character go to defend those beliefs? Who or what taught
those beliefs to the character? Remember that a character's moral and
ethical beliefs, not necessarily his behavior, defines his alignment. What
is his/her alignment?

7. Does the character have any unusual habits or physical traits? What are
they? What do they stem from? How do others tend to react to them?

8. What is the general reaction to the character by other characters? Why,
in the character's opinion, do they act that way?

9. Can the character kill? When did he decide (or learn) that he could? Why
would the character kill? Does he/she have any enemies at all? Would or
could the character kill them?

10. What kind of relationships does the character currently have? Does
he/she have any close friends? Bitter enemies? If so, who? What are they
like? What is the history of the character and this person's relationship?

11. Does the character have any mental problems? Phobias? If so, what are
they? What do they stem from?

12. How does the character generally treat others? Does she/he trust easily?
Or not? How does the character relate to people? Is he shy and withdrawn or
outgoing and friendly?

13. What does the character look like? Does he/she have any scars or
tattoos? If so how did she/he get them? Obviously this includes eye and hair
color, but an unusual gait (walking style) or accent comes into play here as
well.

14. What is the character's normal daily routine? How does he/she feel when
it's interrupted for whatever reason?
READ HELP 20QUESTIONS3
~

-1 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` 20Questions3 (RolePlayClanInfo)~
15. Was the character present during any key events in the history of the
campaign world? How did that event affect the character?

16. Does the character have a notorious or celebrated ancestor? What did
he/she do? What do people assume about the character when his/her ancestry
is known? Does the character actively try to live up to the reputation, try
dispel it or try to ignore it?

17. Where is the character's homeland? What is its history and what are its
people like? Is the character patriotic, or a social outcast? What is his
opinion of home?

18. What are the character's dreams? Ambitions? Goals?

19. How does she/he seek to obtain them? How does adventuring fit into this
dream, or does it at all?

20. Does the character ever want to have a family of his/her own someday? If
so with who or what type of person?

Well done. A character is born! Fill out your notes onto a character sheet
and enjoy playing it.

-1 `7[`5Q`Pu`7e`Ps`5T`7]`` "Hot Potato" (ImmQuest)~
Here are the `#RULES`` (follow them or `!d`1i`!e``) 1.  Do `#NOT`` drop the potato,
Whomever drops the potato will receive an `PIDIOT`` flag.  2.  You will all
begin each round in a separate room, the immortal will give the 'hot potato'
to one of you and announce `@GO``.  When you see `@GO``, you will all run around the
battlefield giving the 'hot potato' to anyone you can.  3.  Whomever ends
up with the potato at the end of the round's alotted time, is out via
`1d`!eath`` from `3a`#bove``.  	- The [`5Q`Pu`7e`Ps`5t``] ends when only one person is left.

The next rule is `@BIG``, don't break it or you will face our wrath.  4.  `#NO
`6Triggers, `#NO `6Aliases, `#NO `6Spamming`` 'Give potato 1.  or 2. ' or
'Push 1.  west' etc. , `#NO`` Directional arrows, `#NO `6Hotkeys, and `#NO `6Macros `!PERIOD``.
`PWE WANT YOU TO TYPE IN EVERY COMMAND`` - this is VERY clear, and we will
have no pity
on your soul.

Hence you can't sit in one room and just give the potato back to whomever
gave it to you right away or come up with some sort of other method of
not getting the potato or giving up the potato immediately after someone
gives it to you.

Plus if we see any other `3cheesy`` ideas, to cheat, you will be out (plus
bonus punishments at the discretion of the immortals).  We want you to
receive the potato then have to run around and catch someone.

5.  You must have room in your inventory to receive the 'hot potato',
there shall be no spamming 'create feast' and getting all the mushrooms
to fill your inventory.  6.  No Sneaking, Hiding or going Invisible.  The
war prep room will be fogged by the immortal running the quest.  So
Aiels, don't take your boots off and put them back on to get your race
skill to kick in.  Sprites will not be able to use their invisible race
skill either.  7.  `#NO`` Attacking or Killing at all, 'cept by the immortals
of course :)

Lastly, Have `@F`@U`ON``, Please.

-1 SAVESVSSPELLS SAVES_VS_SPELLS~
Saves vs. spells determines how often a spell will hit.  It works the same
as armor class, for example, a -150 saves vs. spells is better than a -50
saves. vs spells.  If you have a low saves vs. spells, spells are less
likely to hit you.  If your saves are high, spells are more likely to hit.
Saves also compensates for the offensive spell level bonuses that you and
your opponent receives from Intelligence and Wisdom.

~

-1 "Coby Doesn't Do"~
If you are reading this, you were probably forced to by Coby.  Take
heed to this warning, for your own personal benefit.

1. I don't do imm jobs, like restrings, cashing in tokens, etc. I only do
Cobytokens.

2. Don't ask me to restring your title.

3. Don't ask me about clans/code/anything related to the game inside out.

4. Don't ask me any questions you could ask someone else, unless someone else
isn't on to deal with it.

5.  As a whole, I (Coby) tend to only deal with situations I *must*
deal with, but if you are confused about something and have TRIED talking to other
Mortals, Immortals, and can not find a clear answer on a rule, stipulation, or
occurrence, direct it in a 'note to IMP', a tell to any IMP, and most importantly
a tell to Coby.

6.  Try to remember that this game is for the enjoyment of all people, including
the IMP and Immortal staff, but as a common courtesy please try to use common sense
before bringing things to our attention (the IMP staff) that could be dealt with by
other Imms or Mortals.

7.  In the past I (Coby) have had a strong feeling of being 'burnt out' by the
constant swarming of issues and situations that should have been dealt by other people.
Don't let this happen.  I am here as a public servant but I'm also here to do my job as
best as I see fit, which includes taking care of myself and my sanity when I am
overwhelmed with issues to be dealt with.  Using the common sense technique as described
in rule #6 you should be able to tell what is appropriate and what is not when it involves
bringing issues to my attention.

8.  People who are here to cause trouble by publicly lying, humiliating, undermining,
in general can be dealt with by any immortal.  I don't need to know who said what about
me, frankly, I don't care.  If someone posts a flame note, the Imms are to delete it,
post a penalty with as little information as needed, for these people are truly worth a
minimum of our time and our swiftest 'harshest' penalties.

If you are in doubt about what level imms can handle what types of tasks, refer to
'`Ohelp imm_levels``'.
~

309 DISENCHANT~
Syntax: disenchant <item>

This command is used to remove enchantments put on an object BY AN
IMMORTAL.  It will *not* remove enchantments from the object that were
already in place.  For instance, if an object had +5 dex when you loaded
it, the +5 dex will not be removed when you disenchant the object. 
However, the -200 ac you added after you loaded the object would be
removed.  

Note: this also removes ALL flags on an item.  

Syntax: disenchant <item> statyouwantdisenchanted

If you need just one or two stats removed from an item, you can use this
syntax and you don't have to add everything back to the item again.  For
instance, "disenchant ring hp" will take off a line of hp from the item. 
~

-1 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` Donate (NewbInfo)~
Syntax: donate <item>

The donate command allows you to donate unwanted items.  It sends the
items to the donation room, located down from `@Jel``.  Please do not
sacrifice these items!  They were donated because the original owner
thought they may be of some use.  If the donation room as an inordinate
amount of items, please alert the nearest immortal, so they can purge the
room.
~

-1 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` FRY FAKEFRY 'FAKE FRY' (NewbInfo)~
Fry is the ultimate punishment.  If you were fried, you were being VERY
bad.  In short, it removes your pfile.  All equipment, gold, levels, etc,
go byebye. It was if we went into the players directory and removed your
file.  You are fried for SERIOUS offenses... so if you are fried, you were
being very bad.

A fake fry is just what the name says... a fake fry.  It isn't real, it
just disconnects you from the game.  Generally, IMPs use this as a warning
that you are too close to breaking a rule.  Don't be too offended when it
happens, just realize that you tweaked someone the wrong way.

Have a nice day.
~

-1 voodoo~
This is a witch only skill.  Voodoo allows the witch to acquire a
Voodoo Doll and "imprint" a victims lifeforce onto it.  Once the
doll has a successfully imprinted victim, the Witch can cast spells
at the victim even if the victim is in another room.

The "imprint" command affects the victim with the "voodoo" affect,
which is cancellable and will negate the witches hex on the victim.
Safe rooms are not safe from the witche's magics, your only recourse
against the spell is to cancel the affect or to ride out the
duration of the affect.  The voodoo affect lasts the caster's
level/30 and affects the victims ability to make saving throws.

To successfully use a voodoo doll, the doll must be held for both
the imprinting and casting. Imprinting and casting cannot be done
in safe rooms.  Successfull imprinting requires 200 mana, all
failures cost 20 mana.  Because the doll is a surrogate for the
victim, casting spells at a voodoo doll are more difficult to
manage - costing 2x normal mana cost and incurring 2x the lag.

SYNTAX:
	imprint <charname>

~

-1 WEB~
Syntax:  c 'web' <target>
`7
This is a mage only spell.  Lasts caster's level/30 and is offensive.
The victim is trapped in sticky strands of webbing and will be unable to
flee.  Also, the victim's chance of casting a spell successfully is cut in
half as well as damage skills cut in half.  Dragons and Giants are very
difficult do web due to their enormous size.  This spell is in the mage
specials group.
~

-1 Max_Dmg~
If you are engaging in any type of player killing <PK> you will not
necessarily do the same amount of damage you would to a mob with the same
stats/eq.  The maximum amount of damage any player can do to another play
is 4X their level.  The ONLY exceptions are the following:

Skills/spells that do 2X damage at max:
aggressive parry

Skills/spells that do 6X damage at max:
circle, dragonslay

Skills/spells that do 9X damage at max:
hand of light, hand of death (clan spells)

Skills/spells that do 10X damage at max:
assassinate

Skills/spells that do 12X (or more) damage at max:
backstab, psychic headbutt <witch or cleric>

This was added to give player killing a more realistic atmosphere, and
to prevent unfairness due to "just their eq" not their pkilling skill.
This affect goes in *any* PK, even a battlefield with peaceful.
~

-1 BLUDGEON~
Syntax: bludgeon <target>

This is a thief only skill.  There are two dicerolls involved, the first one
decides whether or not the victim receives any damage.  The second roll
determines whether or not the victim is knocked unconscious for a certain
amount of ticks.
~

-1 AUCNOTE~
Auction notes are for *any* and *all* selling/buying of characters/equipment/tokens
etc.  Post all notes regarding these subjects under an aucnote. The syntax is the
same as "help note" explains.

Ex: aucnote to all, aucnote subject For sale, aucnote + blah blah, etc.

All regular notes posted as aucnotes will be deleted, same as any aucnotes posted as
regular notes.

For realtime buying and selling, use the '`3auctalk``' channel. See '`#help auctalk``'.
Do `!not`` use `#OOC`` channel for buying/selling/trading items.
~

309 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` CobyLuvinItems (NewbInfo)~
If you save up 150 imp tokens you can get a *bomb* bag of STUFF from Coby
that has, to mention a few, a whole separate bag of tokens that are worth
the cost in and of themselves, a bag of lowbie quest gear and the best
about the body item in the entire game: the cloak of seclusion.

Any imp can redeem the tokens for his luvins, and his saves tokens, 
His 25 train token is redeemable by any 309+

-1 SPEECH~
The requirements of the immortals on BadTrip:
You are on borrowed time.  Any minute now I may realize my mistake in
advancing you and decide to fry you.  As an immortal, you *must* make
yourself available to the mortals as frequently as possible.  The reason
you have your job is to serve the players and make their experience
enjoyable.  The previous rule was visible at least one hour a day, but
I will not hold you to that as long as you are on frequently enough to
keep mortals happy.  If I hear "Where is **, I havent seen him in a while",
I will know you are not doing your job.  You are to *KNOW* all the rules
outlined in both *motd* AND *imotd* so that you may enforce them and
settle disputes.  Once you are clear on the rules, post a note to *all*,
introducing yourself, describing your job, etc.

New immortals:
You *will* be logged completely, if you cheat, you will be caught, banned,
your entire site will lose every single player ever logged in from it, and
you will receive a nice PHAT penalty post.. so don't do it.
Don't ask for advances in levels, because that will probably get you
fried, too.  Just do your job, keep your head up high, prove you have
integrity, and you will be advanced in levels within time.
~

-1 TRIVIA~
The `!TRIVIA`` channel is used by the quest gods to run trivia.
<Obviously>  Due to the overwhelming amount of answers received, we ask
that you do NOT SPAM this channel, AT ALL!!!  It is extremely difficult to
weed through answers, and spam does not help at all.  If you are caught
spamming, you shall be punished, most likely with a nochannel for a bit,
so keep your answers short and sweet. Also, if you want to offer humorous
answers, do so on `#OOC`` or `3shittalk``, `!NOT`` on the `!trivia`` channel.

Keep in mind: When an immortal runs trivia, and your sources say the answer
is different than the one the immortal gives, `#don't push it``.  You may have
more up to date or older info, but when it comes to trivia here, the immortal's
answer is the only one that is going to give you prizes!  If you push your
answer you are likely to get nochanneled or worse.  If you want more trivia
to be run, don't give the immortals shit who do run it!
~

-1 `&[`!R`8U`&L`8E`!S`&]`` Aggressive_Actions~
Aggressive actions are defined as any action which the target has the
option of retaliating against with force, even if the action itself does
not initiate combat.  If you perform an aggressive action on a person,
the person has the option of killing you for it until s/he successfully
does just that.

Aggressive actions include `Opush`7, `Odrag`7, or `Oany spell`7 or `Oaction`` which the
target does `!not`` want, including insults on roleplay channels or notes.

For instance, if you teleport someone against his/her will, that's
aggressive.  If you cast dispel magic on a person against his/her will
that's aggressive, etc.

`#NOTE:`` Casting a spell and reciting a scroll are the same thing.  So
reciting a scroll of whatever is just as aggressive as casting the spell.

All of the above things can get you killed `@once`` in interaction with an
individual.  One thing that can get you `!killed`` a lot more, by a lot more
people than just one is `6insulting a clan directly``.  If you insult every
person, including the leader by doing this, they can kill you over and
over (not multi kill, but daily) until you `#fully remove/retract your
comment`` and `#post a public apology for the insult``.

-1 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` TOKENS Brief_overview_of_tokens_and_token_commands (NewbInfo)~
Tokens are often given as prizes during a quest, dropped randomly for you
to find, given for trivia, seek & find, or as rewards for other things.
These tokens can be saved for special prizes (see '`#help luvin``') or used to
add enchantments to items when enough are collected.  Many of these tokens
may be eaten and will be added to your total.
(see '`#help tshow``' and '`#help trade``')
``
These are the uses for some of the items/enhancements:
``
`PRestring``    - restring one item. (see '`#help restring``').
``
`PWeapon Flag`` - 1 add a flag to a weapon. May also be used to remove an  existing
``              flag from an item (such as an alignment restriction, etc.).
`!NOTE``: You may remove `#1`` extra bit with each weapon flag token, but the
``      `@cache``, `Pgemmed``, and `Obejewelled`` flags may `!not`` be removed
``       in this way at all. ``
``
`PDamage Noun`` - one damage noun token (i.e. stab to chop, etc.).
``
`P200/200``     - one 200/200 token (adds 400 hitpoints, mana or movement to an
``              item, up to legal max). The points may be split between items
``              IF the immortal is willing to do so.
``
`P10/10``       - one 10/10 token (adds 10 hitroll and 10 damroll to an item,
``              up to the legal max). The points may be split between items
``              IF the immortal is willing to do so.
``
`PFireproof``   - one fireproof token. Adds the burn_proof flag to an item,
``              protecting it from burning or becoming etched by acid
``              (losing AC points).
``
`PAC``          - one AC token. Adds up -250 Armor Class to an object. These
``              may also be used to fully restore lost (pitted) AC that was
``              originally on a item. You may `!NOT``, however, use them to
``              increase your (add positive) AC.
``
Other types of special tokens are sometimes given out. They may not be
purchased with regular tokens, but are only given as specially designated
tokens. Some of these tokens may only be given out by `PImplementors`` and
some may be given out by `OImmortals``. These include, but are not
limited to:
``
`@Train tokens`` - used to add trains to a player. They have various values.
`@Race change``  - used to change a player's race.
`@Class change`` - used to change a player's class.
`@Item Beefup``  - used to enhance any one item to 200 hp/200
``               mana/200 move, 10 hitroll/10 damroll, -250 ac,
``               and +1 in each stat.
`@Quest point``  - used to add quest points to a player. They have
``               various values.
`@Skill Set``    - used to set a skill you currently have to 100%
`@Saves``        - used to add negative saves to any eq (up to legal max)
`@Level``        - used to advance players the designated number of levels.
`@Rename``       - used to rename a character.
``
See '`#help immlevels``' for information on what level imm can redeem these
tokens for you.
``
Some combination tokens exist. You may `!not`` receive 'change' for one of
these tokens. You must either use the entire token or lose the part not
applied.
``
`!NOTE``: The max stats that an imm can add are:
50 hitroll, 50 damroll, -40 saves, -1000 AC, 25 per stat, and 1000
hitpoints/mana/move. This means the total for the stats on the item
after the item has been enchanted, i.e. if it already has 450 hitpoints
and 250 mana, the imm can only add 550 additional hitpoints and 750
additional mana to the item.
``
For a more detailed description of the basic types of tokens and what
they do, see '`#help using_tokens``'.

302 OFFENSIVE~
`!Offensive`` Mob Flags:

`#Area_attack:`` makes the mob hit everyone in the room at once, regardless of "teams".
`#Backstab:`` only works if mob is aggressive, allows initial attack to be a backstab.
`7  Does not always work.
`#Bash:`` makes mobs bash. Mobs without this flag simply don't.
`#Berserk:`` Allows the mob to go berserk randomly.
`#Disarm:`` Allows the mob to disarm opponents. Fairly pointless, since most weapons
`7  here are noremove.
`#Dodge:`` most mobs dodge, but this allows mobs to dodge more often.
`#Fade:`` appears to do nothing.
`#Fast:`` gives mobiles better chances to parry, dodge, and certain aggressive skills.
`#Kick:`` allows a mob to kick.
`#Dirt_kick:`` allows a mob to dirt kick.
`#Parry:`` most mobs parry, but this allows mobs to parry more often.

`7  most closely matches its own alignment.
`#Assist_race:`` will jump in on any fight where one of the combatents is its own race.
`7  Will join that person's side.
`#Assist_players:`` will assist any player with a kill. If the fight is player vs. player,
`7  the attack is randomly determined.
`#Assist_guard:`` assists guard flagged mobiles.
`#Assist_vnum:`` assists its own vnum of mobile only.
`#Assassinate:`` does nothing.
`#Quest:`` the one I'm currently working on. `!Do not attempt to flag this until I am done``.
~

-1 BAD_TRIP~
Syntax: cast 'bad trip' <victim>

Bad trip is a unique spell.  Not much is known about it, but people who
have dealt with it call it "colorful".
~

-1 DRAG PUSH~
By typing drag/push <victim> <direction> you may physically <judged by
strength> move other PC's or NPC's.  You may *not* push or drag from
healer unless they have been in prior combat within the last 90 seconds
before the push/drag attempt.  This prevents people "running and hiding"
in healer.  Since it is such an *easy* location to get to.
~

-1 VEIL~
Syntax:  veil

As an Aiel you may veil yourself before combat.
While you are affected by veil all damage you inflict
is increased by 20%.

(1.2 x damage, similar to the "sharp" flag on weapons)

~

-1 `^[`6S`&k`6i`&ll`6S`^]`` HISS (RaceSkillFeline)~

Peppino, `^Exchange``

Many of Bad Trip's most cherished tokens are available from Peppino, who
runs a questionable business out of the Dry Cleaners in Midgaard (1 east of
Hassan or gate to Peppino).  Once you are there check out or buy some of the
goods:

`^exchange list      `7: List the items available through Peppino``
`^exchange buy (item)`7: Buy an item on Peppinos list.``

When you purchase an item, the money is withdrawn from your Midgaard bank account.
`8(`7Peppino's family is mighty close with the bankers of Midgaard`8)``
~

-1 PACK HIT BOWLS BONGS PIPES~
Okay, Eo has implemented Coby's ninja idea..A head shop has moved into NT,
and you can get cool stuff there, pipes, water bongs, etc..  It's pretty
cool.. You'll find it in the southwestern corner of Market Square in New
Thalos.

Syntax: pack <name of bong/pipe here>
Syntax: hit <name of bong/pipe here>
Syntax: unpack <name of bong/pipe here>

These commands allow players to `#pack`` the bowl,
and also `#hit`` the pipe/bong, for a `#HP`` heal bonus..
Should you want to take out whatcha put in... `#unpack`` can help you out.

Each `#hit`` heals various HP, depending on the quality of the weed but if you
`1T`!O`&R`8C`3H`` the bowl (`#1 in 150 chance``) a bonus of XX HP times the number of hits
left in the pipe/bong.. Nifty! (see '`#help weed``' for torch values).

`!You must be holding the bong/pipe in order to pack or hit it!``

If you type '`#look bong``' (or whatever it is you're smoking from), it
should tell you how many hits you have left.. And if you cast
'`#identify``' on your sack, it should tell you approximately how full it
is...
~

-1 play "play loud" "play list" play_loud play_list~
Syntax:  play <song>
`7         play list
`7         play loud <song>

Play allows you to play a song on the jukebox.  Unfortunately, you cannot
hear it if you aren't in the same room as the juke.  For global listening,
just use the play loud syntax (see above).  However, this costs quite a
bit of gold.

To see the play list of a juke box, just type "play list" at the juke.
~

-1 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` Finger (NewbInfo)~
Syntax:  finger <PC>

When you finger a person, it shows their pkills and pdeaths, as well as
their level and description.
~

-1 RAVAGE~
Ravage is a powerful warriors skill.  In a sudden burst of energy, the
warrior ravages his foes.  This skill is similar to kick, only causes
more damage and takes no movement.  However, it automatically lags the
attacker and victim 1 full round of combat.  It hits twice, with a 5%
chance of hitting a third time.
~

-1 `&[`6S`^p`!e`^ll`6S`&]`` BARKSKIN BARK SKIN (Spell)~
Syntax: cast 'bark skin' <target>

Bark skin creates a thick layering of bark around your armor, increasing
your chances of avoiding a blow.  It is found in the protection spell
group.
~

-1 'Air Armor' ~
Syntax: cast 'air armor' <target>

Casting air armor improves your AC by -203. The duration of the
spell is affected by the level of the caster.
~

-1 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` Mana (NewbInfo)~
Mana is the amount of magic you can cast.  Each character only has so much
magic they can use, before they become drained.  All spells cost mana, so
be sure and watch your amount.
~

-1 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` HitPoints (NewbInfo)~
Hitpoints are the measure of how much of a beating your character can take
before he/she/it dies.  Once your hitpoints reach zero, you are sent back
to `@Jel`7.  Also, when you level, the higher your constitution (CON)
the higher your hitpoint gain per level.
~

-1 `&[`!R`8U`&L`8E`!S`&]`` NPK PCFL~
If you are `Opeaceful``, that means you do `!not`` engage in `&*`#any`&*`` kind of `!PK`` situation.
This includes stealing from other players using the steal skill or even by lying
to them or cheating them in a deal.

If you're in the battlefield that's the only time you can `!PK``, and of course, the
battlefield has its own rules on things you can and cannot do.

IF you do things that regularly resemble `!PK`` situations, you could find yourself
without a character.

`OPeaceful `7(`ONPK``) characters are not allowed to make ANY aggressive actions toward a
`!PK`` character ('`#help aggressive``' for more info), nor can they intervene in a `!PK``
situation by helping 1 of 2 people in a pfight...not by healing, spelling up, or
anything.

`!PK`` characters are not allowed to lie, cheat, or steal from `ONPK`` characters. If that
happens, the `!PK`` character will be duly punished, up to and including the removal of
the character.

`ONPK``'s show up in [] in the who list, while `!PK``'ers show up in `!()``.
~

302 `7[`5Q`Pu`7e`Ps`5T`7]`` Imm_Capture_The_Flag ImmCTF (ImmQuestHelp)~
Some information for the immortals using the CTF area.

Vnum `O4200`` is the death repop room for the `OBlue`` Tower.
Vnum `!4201`` is the death repop room for the `!Red`` Tower.
Vnum `54202`` is the death repop room for the `5Purple`` Tower.
Vnum `@4203`` is the death repop room for the `@Green`` Tower.

These rooms are usable only after a death, and greatly increase the
regeneration rate of the players inside it.  For even higher boosted
regen, rest or sleep on the couch provided in each room.  There are flags
of each tower color premade and ready to load.

Note: The `8rottweilers`` are in the room to keep people from getting cheesy
free restores by summoning a mob in or various other methods. At the `#beginning``
of your quest, force them to sleep so they don't attack the questors. At the
`@end`` of the quest, wake them to resume guarding the rooms.
~

610 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` IMP_ADMIN_RULES (ImmInfo)~
`PT``hese are the rules and basic guidelines in order to keep the coding and
Admin staff together, un "power struggling" and such, and so forth.
`!I``f you are a coder, I expect you to post a change, even if you're fixing a
damn mob string, it's really best.. if you fix several.. say you fixed
several.. it's simple.
<smile>
`1I``f a delimma comes up, involving judging a PK, grey area of the RULES..
anything.. you talk to ME.. me is Coby... George.. you all know me.. and
`@I``'m here to try to keep us all intact so we can all figure out all the
areas we need covered, and so forth.
`#I``, personally, like the larger staff, and think it can work, it just takes
coordination, and that's not only from me.
`OI``f you add in a help file, post a change, if you find one missing, add
it in.  Just post a note to me, don't be afraid to put a "situation" on
hold.  Thank you.  George--
~

-1 format formatting~
`#1.`` If you compose your notes online, use carriage returns to end the lines
`7   (that is, hit enter to end the line). You can make fairly uniform line
`7   lengths by noticing some kind of visual marker on your screen. It might
`7   be something on your task bar or something in your client window or
`7   whatever you can find to visually mark a good end point for each line
`7   of your note. When the line you're typing gets to that place on your
`7   screen, hit enter to end the line.
`7
`#2.`` Don't compose your notes online *grin*. Short notes are fine in the online
`7   editor, but long unformatted notes are very hard to follow. Try composing
`7   them offline (in Notepad or any other `!text`` editor of your choice) and then
`7   pasting them into the mud a few lines at a time. Below are the steps to do
`7   this most effectively.
`7
`#   A.`` Type in the text of your note/RPnote in its entirety, getting it to
`7      read the way you want it to. Use carriage returns (enter key) to end
`7      each line. This gives you control over the format and makes lines a
`7      uniform and easily readable length.
`#   B.`` Go back and insert any `!c`#o`@l`Po`^r `Oc`@o`!d`#e`Ps`` you want in the note. Do not adjust
`7      line lengths. Color codes will make your line look longer in the editor
`7      but they will not add visible length to the line in the note on the mud.
`#   C.`` After the colors are in, go back and put '`^note + ``' or '`^rpn + ``' at the
`7      beginning of each line, depending on what kind of note it is. You can
`7      type it out once, then copy and paste it down on each subsequent line.
`#   D.`` In the mud, type your 'to' line and your subject line, then paste in your
`7      note from the editor a few lines at a time. When you're done pasting in
`7      your note, do a '`^note show``' or '`^rpn show``' to make sure it looks like you
`7      want it to, then post it. If you need to make adjustments, clear it, fix
`7      the problems in the editor, then repaste it.
`7
`@Tip:``  If you want to add blank space at the beginning of a line, open a color code
(such as gray - 7) then add your spaces. This works quite well to allow leading spaces.
`7
This seems like a lot of work, but in the long run it can save you lots of
frustration. If you save periodically in your editor you don't have to worry
about losing your work to a crash or having to log off and losing all your
hard work. It also makes your notes/rpnotes much more enjoyable and easy to
read for others.
~

-1 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` WISH WISH_CHANNEL (NewbInfo)~
Syntax:  wish <your wish>
`7
The `Owish`` channel is a special channel, only seen by the immortals, and the
mortal using the channel.  The `Owish`` channel is used for special requests,
such as asking for an immortal who might not be visible, or other
requests.  Do not abuse this channel, for it can be taken away as well.
 
~

-1 BLACK_PLAGUE 'BLACK PLAGUE'~
Syntax:  c 'black plague' <target>

This causes the victim <mobile or PC> to sweat blood from their pores,
obviously inflicting insane amounts of damage, mana loss, and movement
loss.  It lasts a certain amt of ticks, based on levels, and lowers the
character's <mob or PC as well> strength.
~

-1 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` Immortal_staff's_WISH_LIST (NewbInfo)~
`@W`6i`@SH L`6i`@ST``
These are not exactly rules, but they are things which the immortal staff
would like to see the mortals do.

`#BRING FRIENDS``
Please bring your friends, co-workers, and others to Bad Trip.  A great
way to build the player base is to tell your friends how much you
personally enjoy being on here.

`#RESPECT``
Respect is EXTREMELY important.  We would like to see you have respect in
your dealings with other players.  There is no need to flame, or
excessively bother someone.  Also, when you are with an immortal, respect
is definately needed, by both the immortal and the player.  If you are in
an immortal's room, don't leave unless they say you may go (usually a
trans is needed anyhow).  Immortals need to let the players blow off some
steam, then rationally discuss whatever situation has risen.  If you need
to make an appeal, please note your appeal to 'imp'.
~

-1 LASTON~
The laston command shows when a PC last logged onto Bad Trip.  You must
use the FULL name of the person you wish to laston.

~

-1 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` Page (NewbInfo)~
Paging someone sends a beep (or some other annoying noise) to the person

as bad as spamming someone with tells, so DON'T DO IT.
Syntax:  page <person>
~

0 FEED~
Syntax:  feed <victim>

Vampires are undead creatures that feeding upon victims to gain nourishment.
This skill is used in place of eat and drink, for if a vampire eats food,
or drinks something other than blood, their insides begin to burn.  Feed
draws the life from victims and will damage your PC opponents, especially
if they are sleeping. You can only feed on "live" victims (PCs or mobs) -
you cannot feed from a blood fountain.
~

-1 INTIMIDATE INTIMIDATION~
Warriors can sometimes use their size and bulk in other ways, such as
intimidating others to doing their bidding.  While not always successful,
the bigger the warrior, the better the chance of intimidating someone.

However, weaker warriors should beware - if they fail to intimidate
their target, there is a chance that the target may become disgruntled,
and take out their frustrations on that warrior!

Intimidate costs 100 mana and 80 move to activate.
~

-1 BREATHE~
Dragons can breathe on foes, casting a random spell from the draconian
group.  Since it is a random spell, it is sometimes an area spell.  The
strength of the spell is based not only on level, but also on how many
current hit points you have.
Syntax:  breathe <victim>
It has an activation cost: 75 mana.
~

-1 `^[`6S`&k`6i`&ll`6S`^]`` Rake (RaceSkillFeline)~

~

-1 KNEECAP~
Syntax:  kneecap <target>

This is a very powerful dwarven racial skill. It uses their short, squat build
and natural strength to attack their victim at the knees, causing damage and
halving the victim's movement with each successful hit. Kneecap has an activation
cost of 50 movement for the dwarf.
~

-1 DREAM~
Syntax:  dream <pc/npc>   You must wait a tick before the skill kicks in.

Dream is a skill the Aiel developed in the Waste.  It allows them to move
from place to place by dreaming of their destination.  Obviously, you must
be sleeping to dream.

Each time an aiel dreams, there is a 75% chance to heal 1/2 of your lost HP
and mana up to his/her natural max.
~

-1 CIRCLE~
Circle is a skill both elves and dark-elves have.  With their small
stature, they are able to sneak around their opponent, and attack them
from behind.  It is similar to a backstab, except it does less damage.

slightly more.
Syntax:  circle <victim>

It costs 50 activation points to start - 50 from hit points/mana/movement.
~

-1 ESP~
ESP is a skill which humans developed as protection as more and more races
came to be known.  ESP allows humans to know where their target is, of any
race.  On top of that, you see all skills and spells they activate.  This
is a skill only humans posses, as it was their only hope of survival.  ESP
must be activated in the same room as the target.
Syntax:  'esp <player>' - to cancel, 'esp self'.

-1 'BFIELD' 'BATTLEFIELD' 'BATTLEGROUND'~
The battlefield is an area of the world that is designated for
killing. Anyone can enter, PCFL or PK, and be able to kill their
fellow participants.  All level limits are eliminated.

To enter an open battlefield, type "battlefield I love you" and you
will be transferred into the "War Prep Room" where you can wait until
the battlefield is "closed". After it is closed, everyone who entered
will be transferred to a random spot in the battlefield and the
battle begins.

-1 'FIXSCREEN' 'FIX'~
The `#fixscreen`` command is used to fix your screen, in case the ANSI colour
messes up your terminal. To use it, one must simply type:

	`#fixscreen <`&number`#>``,

where `&number`` is the number of lines your terminal handles. If you don't put
a numeric value, it will default to 25 lines.

~

-1 FIREBLADE~
Creates a fireblade that you automatically wield
that really kicks butt.  It has an automatic timer
set on it based on your level, so it doesn't last
forever.

Do not auction a fireblade. If the timer runs out while it's on auction
you will lose eq and possibly your character. Reimbursements will not be
made under any circumstance.
~

-1 'ACIDIC RAIN'~
Acidic is a spell used by only mages.  They may only cast this in the
battlefield or capture the flag quests.  It damages every opponent in the
area and casts bad trip on them.  This is agressive, it costs 2500 mana,
and you must have a receiving victim for it to be casted successfully.
~

-1 'MAGE SPECIALS' MAGESPECIALS MAGE_SPECIALS~
The mage specials group contains these spells:

Web: similar to "fear", but in addition to holding victim in place, also
lowers the victim's success rate at spell casting and prevents your victim
from doing physical damage.

acidic rain: damages EVERY PLAYER in the area when casted, 2000 mana,
level 300 to use.. <BATTLEFIELD SPELL or CAPTURE THE FLAG>

time warp: does just that... warps time as the MUD knows it.  Useful
spell.  Say you're firebreathed, or an opponent fled/hid with black plague
from you.. etc.

Blood Boil: serious damage to victim, raises the victim's saves, and negatively
affects your victim's strength and dexterity.

Ring of fire: serious dmg to everyone in room, including group members,
also in adjacent rooms <ie. north/south/east/west/up/down> for a one room
span.  Ie. you can kill people w/o being in the same room with them.

Meteor swarm: tons of damage to caster and everyone in room

reverse alignment: nasty damage to target and switches target/caster align

Blink: Every other round you are invulnerable to all melee & magical damage
125 mana to cast, 200 mana per blink, not cancellable

Grandeur: creates an illusion making the mage seem twice as powerful.  It
doubles the mage's current hit points and costs one mana for every eight
hit points increased.
~

-1 IDIOT_FLAG IDIOT~
The `PIDIOT`` flag is a penalty designed for gods to deal with moronic
mortals. If you receive this flag, you cannot do certain things, including
use of the Healer's services, can't speak correctly, and directions are
interesting... quite effective punishment, you don't want it.
~

-1 CAPSLOCK LOCK~
If you are using a public channel, regardless of which it is, and use the
caps lock on more than four different times, and a god is on, expect to
lose that channel, possibly all of them, forever.  If not forever, for a
set amount the god tells you.  If you get on a different character and
complain <expecially publicly> you will find yourself in more trouble.
So do us a favor, and the rest of the mud, SHUT THE HELL UP AND KEEP YOUR
BULLSHIT TO YOURSELF :)
~

-1 BLOOD BOIL BLOODBOIL~
Blood boil is a spell in the mystical group.  Blood boil does MASSIVE
damage to the target, sometimes sending their temperature rising, in which
they get -dex and -str.

It also adds +50 saves vs. spells on the first successful cast and can be
stacked to a total of +100. The spell can be cast for damage after that, but
the saves penalty will not exceed +100 from this spell no matter how many
times it's cast.
~

-1 Mystical Mystical_Group~
The mystical group contains these spells:

Darkness          Witch only - Cloaks the witch in an inpenetrable cloud of
                  blackness that only a witch in darkness can see through.

Time Warp         Warps the MUD's time as we know it.

Blood boil        -2 dex -3 str and very good damage.

Revive            Calls the God's favor to restore lost Hit Points.

Druid Call        Calls the druids' to protect you blocking 1/4th dmg recived.

Reverse Alignment Nasty damage to target, and switches target/caster alignment.

Bloody Tears      Chance of blinding, good damage, low mana cost.

Blackmantle       Prevents target from reviving, healing or benefitting from any
                  heal spell.
~

-1 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` EWHO EXTENDED_WHO_LIST (NewbInfo)~
The '`#ewho``' command is useful to see certain statistics about connected
players, including mobs killed, mob deaths, players killed, player deaths,
level, and clan name. This is useful for seeing just who are the badasses
around `PB`5ad `@T`2rip``.
~

-1 STRENGTH~
`!Strength``
 
Strength controls how much weight you can carry.
All physical attacks get additional damage added on
based on your total strength.  This damage is equal
to your total strength divided by two, this damage
is applied before protections.
 
The maximum amount of damage you can deal is also
modified by strength `#(see 'help max_dmg')``.
The higher the strength, the higher the upper limit
for your maximum damage.
Damage bonuses only take effect when you have exceeded
the natural maximum strength for your race `#(see 'help maxstats')``
 
Your damroll is also affected by strength at a rate
of strength times three divided by two. `&(STR x 3 / 2)``
~

-1 INTELLIGENCE~
`!Intelligence``
 
Your Intelligence, which has no maximum, controls how
quickly you can learn a spell when practicing it. 
 
Intelligence also controls how much mana you receive 
when you gain a level.
 
Your Intelligence also affects the level that you cast offensive spells 
based on your Intelligence divided by three. `&(Level + INT / 3)``
 
`#Example:`` A level 300 mage casting an offensive spell with 120 Int
is actually casting casting the spell at level 340.
~

-1 WISDOM~
`!Wisdom``
 
Your Wisdom, which has no maximum, contols how many practices
you receive per level `#(see 'help practice')``.
 
Your overall Wisdom also affects the level that you cast defensive
spells based on your Wisdom divided by three. `&(WIS / 3)``
 
`#Example:`` A level 300 mage casting a defensive spell with 120 Wis 
is actually casting casting the spell at level 340.
~

-1 DEXTERITY~
`!Dexterity``
 
Your Dexterity, which has no maximum, controls how
much movement you gain per level.
 
Your overall Dexterity increases your armor class and adds hitroll
at a rate of Strength divided by two plus Dexterity. `&(STR / 2 + DEX)``
 
Overall Dexterity also reduces the amount of lag you receive from
other people's actions/attacks.
 
`#Example:`` When you are bashed, you lag 24 pulses and the number
of pulses will be reduced by your dexterity divided by one hundred
so if you have 200 Dex and you are bashed you will only lag 22 pulses.
~

-1 CONSTITUTION~
`!Constitution``
 
Your Constitution, which has no maximum, controls how
many hit points you receive when you gain a level.
 
Your overall Constitution reduces how much physical damage 
you receive at a rate of Constitution divided by two. `&(CON / 2)``
 
It also reduces the amount of lag you receive from certain 
types of attack like being struck by lightning, which are 
called daze states. 
 
Daze states are unrelated to the normal lag you receive 
from offensive attacks like bash.
~

-1 LUCK~
`!Luck``
 
Your Luck `#(up to your racial maximum) `7controls how
many training sessions you receive per level.
 
At 18 luck, you recieve two trains upon reaching a level.  
 
At 25 luck `@(dragons and humans only)``, you receive three
trains upon reaching each new level.
 
`!Luck is only needed while gaining levels.``
~

-1 GOLD SILVER MONEY~
Midgaard's economy is based on gold and silver coinage (and the lowly copper,
which you as an adventurer are far too proud to carry).  Gold coins are worth
100 silver coins, but are also four times as heavy (25 to the pound, as
opposed to 100 to the pound for silver). Gems can be bought to alleviate weight problems
from the Midgaard jeweller, he charges a mere 10% more than they are worth.
10 gems weigh one pound, and they can be worth more than 100 gold pieces for
the highest quality stones.

The Rune Quest.  The Rules- The Myths- The Legends.  

The Rune Quest is a New form of Quest Being run by Puck.  The runes
themselves are easy to trade for and collect.  Some special Runes are
more difficult to find, and even Harder to Win.  Some Runes will
only stay in the hands of a Living person and will fly from you if you
Die.  So use great Care when collecting these Runes- Others who may be
hunting Runes may also be hunting You.

`!*`& Issue one- Yes You may PK someone for their Runes.  Happy Hunting.  

`!*`& Issue two- No, This does not By-Pass the Multikill Rule.  

There are a total of Twenty-Five(25) Runes in Name.  There are 75 Runes
within the Quest- 3 Levels of Each Rune.  

There Are Prizes For each Level of Redemption, And Later ways to enhance
your equipment through the use of Rune-Phrases, Or sentances of Runes.  

`!*`& Issue three- No, There is no List, no there is not going to be a list,
No there will not be a Guide to the Phrases.  

The Prizes for this quest are quite Complicated.  The Base set of Runes
will win you one prizebag.  These are the common runes you can collect
and Store.  This prize can be added to with the Uncommon Runes that are
not storeable.  Each one beyond the Third will increase your net Prize
Bag.  

The Uncommon Runes Themselves also have a prize- If you can complete a
full set, there will be a secret Redemption you will need to complete to
Recieve a True Scion Rune.  (*If you ever participated in a Daigen Hatin
Quest.....yeah....*) These Special Runes are Made with PK in mind, sorry
PCFL's but its more fun to PK.  PCFL's will have a seperate help added
concerning redemptions of these tokens.  For a PK Char *Who has held and
fought for runes and has not hoarded them on another char(and I will be
watching you hor-like little toads.  )* You may redeem a full set of
Uncommon Runes for A Chance at on Rare Rune- the ones needs to complete a
phrase. PCFL's will redeem them for placeholder tokens or kindly donate
them to other PK chars.  

And that is That!  No more information will be provided and you'll enjoy
every last minute of it or I hill hunt you down and stuff tokens down
your neck.

-1 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` INSULT2 INSULTING2 INSULT_IMM2 (NewbInfo)~
A note to the mortals:  If a god is "in the wrong" PLEASE just write a note
to "Imp" explaining the situation and what has happened before you go off
calling them names.  It keeps your nose clean, and It makes you look like the
good guys/girls.

As you know, on this mud we allow cussing.  This offends some, and I am
truly sorry.  But we allow it, because, believe it or not, majority curses.

A note to the Imms:  If a mortal is insulting you, better to let me
Coby, deal with it.  If you are really pissed.  Quit out.  Come
back. Leave me a note or note to "Imp" about what happened.  Chances are it will
be easier for all of us if that happens.  Remember: We have logs, we can see
when and where <but unfortunately> not WHY you slayed someone.  So if I go into
the logs, see all these slays, and see no notes.. chances are I'll be really
PO'd.

Hope this clears up some odd-ball situations, and prevents further ones.
~

0 VAMPIRE VAMPYRE~
Vampires are a unique race, 8 creation points.  They have perma fly,
perma detect invis and dark vision.  They are vulnerable to wood <of
course>, and resistant to many physical ailments that others are very
vulnerable to. <Plague, Poison>.  They are excellent for any class.

Race Skill:
syntax: feed <victim>
It's the way the vampires feed, you can not eat or drink real food, or it
may hurt you.  It can take away hit points from other players if you feed
on them.  If they are asleep you can do it multiple times. You may only feed
on "live" blood (i.e. blood from a live victim, not a fountain).

syntax: bite <victim>
Like a super feed, this one is an attack initiator with a chance to black plague
your victim with each bite.  Haste adds to its affects.

Watch out for the sun:
If you aren't indoors, and it isn't night, you will receive a -150 -150
hitr/damr penalty. If it's you are indoors or it's NIGHT you wil receive a
hitroll/damroll bonus equal to the character level. This is not cancellable.
~

0 PSYCHIC HEADBUTT~
spell:  'psychic headbutt'
group:  'attack'

This is a high level (200+) that inflicts (lots of) mental damage onto an
opponent.
~

0 BRIEF COMPACT~
Brief and compact help set your display options for the game. Typing brief
toggles on and off the showing of room descriptions when you move around
(considerably reducing the text to be processed), and typing compact
removes the extra blank line before your prompt.
~

-1 DEAF~
The deaf toggle turns off incoming tells, helpfull if you are being bombarded
by messages from other players.  You can still use reply (see 'help reply') to
reply to people who were telling you before you went deaf, although you
cannot reply to a deaf person unless you or they are a diety (it's mostly
useful for sending a quick "I'm being spammed so I went deaf" message to
a person).
~

-1 playerflags "player flags" player_flags~
These are some flags found on Bad Tip, and a short description.
`7
`1K`!i`1ller `7- Given to those obnoxious PK fiends who attack in a town.
This flag isn't all that reliable, and doesn't mean a thing, except
this person pkills.  Oh, and certain mobs attack KiLLERS...
`7
`8TH`7i`8EF`7 - Given to those who attempt to steal an item, but fail.  Good
thieves don't have flags announcing who they are.
`7
`PIDIOT`7 - Name says it all, this flag is a punishment given to IDIOTS.
`7
`3T`#a`3RGET`7 - This allows low level shittalkers to be in range for PK
by normally out of range players.  Be careful how you RP, you could find
yourself hunted.
~

-1 RP ROLEPLAY~
It's been awhile since we've had decent RP on BT so I thought I would
throw together this help file to HOPEFULLY inspire some of you to be
creative, if nothing else, teach you that that's what it takes, and if you
are unwilling to give it, hoping that you realize you aren't clan material
for this mud.

First off.  The help files are a very vague general concept this time
around.. that's because in the old system, people relied on the help files
for all their RP material.  Guess what we've learned.. that's not RP..
that's cut and paste and rewording.  Now we want the next leap.  True RP.
Do all Dominion members eat flesh? nope.  Do all Solaris members act
fanatically like their RP outlines?  Nope.  Do all the Armada guys act the
same?  nope.  There is a lot more to it than Color, or subclan, that's
what a lot of people don't get.

All that we're giving you is the building blocks, its up to you to take it
from there.  These are a few "categories" to help you build a full
character.  NOT ONLY FOR PERSONAL RP.. but most importantly HOW IT AFFECTS
CLAN RP!!!

1.  Find a fetish.  Maybe you like to taste blood.  Maybe you enjoy
torturing people.  Maybe you can be intelligent enough to RP having a 6th
sense if it doesn't delve too far OOC.  Perhaps you could have a
disability that requires you to compensate with this fetish.  I really
don't want to give examples to be ripped of, I mainly want you to THINK,
and CREATE.

2.  Find a signature.  Maybe you sign your notes in blood, maybe your
signature isn't a signature at all, but perhaps more built around your
mannerisms, the way you detest society and interaction, the way you think
butterflies should rule the world.. seriously guys.. if you put thought
into it.. and effort.. even these ridiculous suggestions can work.  It
just takes time and effort. and once you establish your character, its all
fun and games.  Then you just work with the traits you've established and
interact with others, and BOOM.. guess what.. that's the RP.
(`!if you want to learn more, read help RP2/help roleplay2``)
~

-1 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` RP2 (RolePlayClanInfo)~
3. Find a peeve/peeves.  Every character for the PK rp (or even PCfl RP
system) obviously now has a counter part.  Dominion VS Solaris, Phalanx VS
Armada, and Oracle VS Merchants.  You need to dig deeper than the help
files, that isn't your peeve.. your peeve is the way that people say "heh"
like with Coby (even tho that's RL, its a peeve, right?)  It drives
you insane!! It makes you go into a blind rage and want to kill people!!
It... does whatever you want it to do.. its your creativeness.  Again, as
long as you have the RP to back it, and its well thought out, you won't
see anything but praises for it.  A peeve could be anything from something
to do with any of your senses being aroused in an unpleasant manner to the
smell of burning smoke and the flashbacks of when you were tortured with
fire.. Who knows.. like I said, these are weak suggestions, you really
just build from it, and create your own "little mindframe and world" for
each character.

Last but most important..
4.  Find some peculiarities/characteristics:  Tigrones is manipulative,
always benefiting from anything possible.  Devlin eats who he kills.
Darhoth consumes souls.  Make your char REAL.  Make them more than what
the help files give you.  Give them their own charm, personality, wit,
humor, arrogance, and virtues.  You will be truly amazed and how fantastic
TRUE rp can be.

And last but not least, a small comment.

The new RP system is made to promote LESS stress, unlike the last.
You don't lose eq, there's no reason to be chicken shit.
Do we have to remove PK records for you people to see no downside to
participating?  Seriously guys.  Lets work on getting our act togethers
and building true characters and having GOOD battles with GOOD rp.
Because even those who are clueless can learn.  And believe me, unless
your attempt isn't well thought out, we will not shoot it down, only
suggest things to help improve and evolve it!!  If you have any questions,
PLEASE, talk to your leader, or mortal leader, or if you have TRIED
THAT, and they are BUSY, talk to me Coby, about building RP.
If you have a question that isn't answered, or just want help elaborating
ideas, its one of my newest personally claimed duties to help with this.
Because I do want to eventually get it going good, as a whole, balanced
for each clan because everyone is doing well!!  Thank you for reading
this.

-1 `&[`!R`8U`&L`8E`!S`&]`` PKill PlayerKilling~
Normal player killing rules:
`O-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-``

`!1.`` If you kill someone, you must wait until `Omidnight system time`` until you can attack
   and kill them again.  If `@they`` attack `!you`` again, and die, that is not multikill. If
   they die by your sword and then you go after them and kill them, that `#IS`` multikill.
   If you attack them and it does not result in your kill, it is not multikill, but you take
   quite a risk in attacking and banking on not getting the kill, so do that at your own risk.

`!2.`` If you break the above rule, it's considered a multi-kill, which is illegal.

`!3. NEVER`` initiate a pkill during a reboot sequence.

`@Rule 4 For Clan Members Only:``

`!4.`` To PK, one must first be aggressive. (If someone cancels you etc., you can attack back).
`7   No grey areas.  NO time restraints!!!!

`!5.`7 You can `!NOT!!`7 have a PK then log an alt to kill the same person, this is considered Multi kill. 

`!6`7 You can `!NOT!!`7 place all your gear on your alt to achieve a pk from a lower level player. whom you would not be able to kill with your main character. 

`!7`7 If you are caught using your gear on an alt to Kill Pkill take a bounty on a mortal character you will be `!punished`7 `&NO WARNING `7

`!8. `7You can `!NOT`!!`7 PK the same person with your alts. 1 pk per day per player,

`!Note:`` Using a charmed mob is the same as being in a pk group, all members are considered
to have made the kill, so no "`Pbut my mob killed them``" crap.

See `#help pk2``, `#help aggressive`` and `#help peaceful`` for additional rules.
~

-1 `&[`!R`8U`&L`8E`!S`&]`` PKill2 PlayerKilling2 PK2~
`!1.`` You *may* kill more than your level limit range says if the other player is the
`7   HIGHER level and you initiate the attack.

`!2.`` Steal will only be able to be used to steal gold from now on.

`!3.`` If someone (`!PK``) has a quest flag from a Velveeta quest, you may kill them.

`!4.`` If they have a quest flag from an immortal's quest, you may *not* kill them until
`7   the flag is off and they're done getting their prize or what not.

`!5.`` If someone insults an entire clan, especially publicly, they can be killed over and
`7   over by anyone in the clan regardless of the normal aggression rules (but they may not
`7   multi-kill him). The only way to nullify this is to post a public apology retracting
`7   the insult.

See `#help aggressive`` and `#help peaceful`` for additional rules.
See `#help pk3`` for the `@recommended`` PK tables.
~

-1 `&[`!R`8U`&L`8E`!S`&]`` PKill3 PlayerKilling3 PK3~
Player Killing level ranges are now code restricted.  You may attack
anyone above your own level, and you may attack anyone up to twenty levels
below your own current level.

If someone out of your range because they are too far below your level attacks you
and flees (or you flee) you have 25 ticks to take retribution on them.  During that time
the game will allow you attack THAT PERSON without restriction.  If you attack and they
flee again, the timer starts over.

Once someone dies, that is the end of that battle.

-1 AFK~
Typing AFK puts your character in a tell-saving mode as follows: any tell
to you is stored in a special buffer, and can be seen later by typing
replay.  This is useful when you need to leave the mud for 5 or 10 minutes,
but don't want to miss tells.  AFK shows up in your prompt until it is
turned off.

Tells to link-dead players are stored in a similar fashion, and can also be
seen by typing replay (unless, of course, the character logs off before
reading them).

0 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` Color Available_color_options (NewbInfo)~
To toggle color on/off type: `!color``
To see what the default colors for things like HPs are type: `!color show``
To see what colors are available, type: `!color list``

Make a note of the number next to the item you want to change in color show
and the number next to the color you want in color list. Then to configure
your colors type: `!color set`` <item number> <color number>

Example: color set 9 12  will set your hitpoints to purple.

We also have color codes that may be used in things like your title,
etc.  To get a list of these `Ocodes`` and `#how to use`` them type: `!color codes``

-1 'CLOUD OF DEATH'~
Syntax: cast 'cloud of death' <target>

A cloud sent from the caster goes into the room, causing harm to the
victim, with a 1 in 10 chance of causing black plague.

It can also add +25 saves vs. spell per cast, up to a max of +100.

~

0 DEATH2~
When your character dies, you are reincarnated back at the Altar of the Temple
of Midgaard.  Your corpse is left behind in the room where you were killed,
together with all of your equipment.

Most Maladictions which were affecting you are canceled by death.

Following and groups are not affected by death.

You lose experience for dying.  You will lose all the experience you have
gained for that level bracket.  So if you needed 1 exp point to reach level
300, and you die, you need to gain all the experience from level 299 to 300
ALL over again.  So don't die...

Corpses decay after time, and the objects inside corpses decay with them.
Player corpses last *roughly* 30 hours of game time (15 minutes of real time).

If you are below level 10, your equipment will stay on your characer... but after
that, you better find a way to get that equipment back!

~

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need a set
amount of experience points for each level based on your creation points.

You gain experience by:

    being part of a group that kills a monster

You lose experience by:

    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of certain spells
    dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; and some random variation.
~

0 PET PETS~
You can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may own only one pet at a time, after
the old one dies you may purchase a replacement.

New pets are planned for a shop in New Thalos.

If there is a buildup of pets, please let an immortal know (tell or wish
channel) so they can purge your pets.  If you repeatedly leave your pets
around BT without informing an immortal, you may be punished with an
Idiot flag.
~

0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.
~

0 !~
Syntax: !

! repeats the last command you typed.
~

0 NORTH SOUTH EAST WEST UP DOWN~
Syntax: north
Syntax: south
Syntax: east
Syntax: west
Syntax: up
Syntax: down

Use these commands to walk in a particular direction.
~

0 CAST~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>

Before you can cast a spell, you have to practice it.  The more you practice,
the higher chance you have of success when casting.  Casting spells costs mana.
The mana cost decreases as your level increases.

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

See also the help sections for individual spells.
~

0 EXITS~
Syntax: exits

Tells you the visible exits of the room you are in.  Not all exits are visible.
You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).
~

0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

DROP drops an object, or some coins, on the ground.

GET gets an object, either lying on the ground, or from a container, or even
from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.
~

0 EQUIPMENT INVENTORY~
Syntax: equipment Syntax: inventory

EQUIPMENT lists your equipment (armor, weapons, and held items). 
INVENTORY lists your inventory.  

`#Level Limit``: Level of the object, minus 30, divided by 2.  Level 450
object can be worn at level 210.  (450-30)/2

Just another word about equipment..... In order to have any
immunities/resistances etc.  that are on a piece of eq surrounding you,
it is necessary to newly wear the piece of eq each time you logon.  For
example, if you have a piece of eq with a "resist_acid" flag on it, upon
logging in, you must remove the piece and wear it again in order for the
"resist_acid" flag to be in effect. 
~

0 COMPARE~
Syntax: compare <object-1> <object-2>
Syntax: compare <object>

COMPARE compares two objects in your inventory.  If both objects are weapons,
it will report the one with the better average damage.  If both objects are
armor, it will report the one with the better armor class.

COMPARE with one argument compares an object in your inventory to the object
you are currently wearing or wielding of the same type.

COMPARE doesn't consider any special modifiers of the objects.
~

0 FLEE~
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.
~

0 EXAMINE LOOK GLANCE~
Syntax: look 				Syntax: look    <object>
Syntax: look    <character> 		Syntax: look    <direction>
Syntax: look    <keyword> 		Syntax: look in <container>
Syntax: look in <corpse>
Syntax: examine <container> 		Syntax: examine <corpse>
Syntax: glance <character>

LOOK looks at something and sees what you can see. With a character, LOOK
gives you their description and condition.

GLANCEing at a character gives you their condition, equipment, and if your
peek succeeds, a list of their inventory.

EXAMINE is short for 'LOOK container' followed by 'LOOK IN container'.
~

0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
~

0 sleep~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake
Syntax: sit

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

When you sleep/rest/sit if you have a piece of furniture in your
inventory that's useable for that, you will automatically use it.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters. If you are resting/sleeping
on furniture, you automatically pick it up when you wake.

`!IF YOU QUIT`` while sleeping on furniture, it stays in the room,
`!NOT`` in your pfile. Remember to wake and retrieve your furniture
before you quit.

For help on the sleep spell, see `!help spellsleep``.
~

0 GTELL ; REPLAY SAY TELL OSAY~
Syntax: gtell <message> Syntax: say <message> Syntax: tell <character> <message>

All of these commands send messages to other players.  GTELL sends a
message to all of the characters in your group, wherever they are, even
if they are sleeping or stunned or dying.  ';' is a synonym for GTELL. 

SAY sends a message to all awake players in your room.  The single quote
( ' ) is a synonym for SAY. 

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world. 

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will
work even if you can't see the player, and without revealing their
identity.  This is handy for talking to invisible or switched immortal players. 

OSAY sends a message to all awake players in your room with an ooc
prefix.  Never again will you have to worry about your says being taken
in character or out of character during an rp session!

-1 notes changes news penalties penalty rpnotes aucnotes unread qnotes contests~
The note system works as a message board akin to in-game email.

reading notes:
`3Syntax``           : `3Function``
`#note list``        : shows all notes (unread notes are marked with an N)
`#note read``        : either by number, or reads the next unread note
`#note remove``      : removes a note that you wrote or are the target of
`#note catchup``     : marks all unread notes of that type as read
`#catchup``          : marks all unread notes of any type as read
`#note list`` <PC>   : lists all notes from that player

writing new notes:
`#note to``          : sets the to line (playername, clanname, immortal, or all)
`#note subject``     : sets the subject for a new note
`#note +``           : adds a line to a new note (i.e. note + hi guys!)
`#note -``           : remove a line from a note in progress
`#note clear``       : erase a note in progress
`#note show``        : shows the note you are working on
`#note post``        : posts a new note. This MUST be done to post a note.

modifying posted notes:
`#note forward``     : note forward <#> takes the text of the note and
                   allows you to append additional text at the end
                   assign new recipients and re-post it.
`#note reply``       : note reply <#>  takes the text of the note allows
                   you to make changes and automatically addresses it
                   back to the original sender.
`#note recall``      : note recall <#> allows you to edit a note that you
                   have previously posted and re-post it.
When you log in, you will be informed if there are unread notes waiting. Type
note read to read through them one at a time.

Seven other note directories exist:

`#rpnote``           : Role-Playing notes and information.
`                    (Your parents are alive)
`#aucnote``          : Buyin or selling of goods and services.
`#qnote``            : To give thanks and discuss Immortal Quests.
`#contest``          : Information about in game Contests.
`#news``             : News updates.                       (Immortal Only)
`#change``           : Changes to game play, socials, etc. (Immortal Only)
`#penalty``          : Penalties for rule breakers.        (Immortal Only)

They are used the exact same way, for example penalty read 5 will read
penalty #5. The 'unread' command can be used to show
your unread notes on all the note spools.

Syntax: shout   <message>
Syntax: yell    <message>

SHOUT sends a message to all awake players in the world.  To curb excessive
shouting, SHOUT imposes a three-second delay on the shouter.

GOSSIP and CGOSSIP are variants of SHOUT (without the delay).  '.' is a
synonym for GOSSIP.

YELL sends a message to all awake players within your area.

Type a channel name by itself to turn it off.

0 Emote Pmote Pose~
Syntax: emote <action>
Syntax: pose

EMOTE is used to express emotions or actions.  Besides EMOTE, there are
several dozen built-in social commands, such as CACKLE, HUG, and THANK
(type socials or help socials for a listing).

PMOTE is similar to emote, but will substitute you and your for a target's
name (i.e. pmote bonks Alander will be read as "bonks you" by Alander, and
as "bonks Alander" by everyone else).

POSE produces a random message depending on your class and level.
~

602 SMOTE~
Syntax: smote <action>

Smote works exactly like emote, except you must place your name somewhere in
the string, and it will show that string to everyone in the room.
~

0 HOLD REMOVE WEAR WIELD~
Syntax: hold   <object>
Syntax: remove <object>
Syntax: wear   <object>
Syntax: wear   all
Syntax: wield  <object>

it as equipment.  HOLD is for light sources, wands, and staves.  WEAR is for
armor.  WIELD is for weapons.

WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your
inventory.

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.

REMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into your
inventory.
~

0 BUG TYPO~
Syntax: bug <message>

Syntax: score
Syntax: time
Syntax: weather

AREAS shows you a list of areas in the game.

COMMANDS shows you all the commands in the game.

REPORT shows your current statistics to you and also announces them to other
players in the room.  SCORE shows much more detailed statistics to you only.
Your ability scores are shown as true value(current value), so for example
Str: 15(23) means you have a 15 strength from training, but a 23 strength
from other factors (spells or items).

TIME shows the game time, as well as the time the mud was last started,
and the current local time for the host computer.

Syntax: where
Syntax: where <character>

WHERE without an argument tells you the location of visible players in the same
area as you are.

WHERE with an argument tells you the location of one character with that name
within your area, including monsters.
~

0 HELP~
Syntax: help
Syntax: help <keyword>

HELP FIND lists all available help files.

HELP <keyword> shows a page of help on that keyword.  The keywords include
all the commands, spells, and skills listed in the game.
~

0 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` DESCRIPTION DESC (NewbInfo)~
Syntax: description <string>
Syntax: description + <string>
Syntax: description -

Sets your long description to the given string.  If the description string
starts with a '+', the part after the '+' is appended to your current
description, so that you can make multi-line descriptions. You can delete
lines by uses description -.
~

0 PASSWORD~
Syntax: password <old-password> <new-password>

PASSWORD changes your character's password.  The first argument must be
your old password.  The second argument is your new password.

The PASSWORD command is protected against being snooped or logged.
~

0 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` Title (NewbInfo)~
Syntax: title <string>

Sets your title to a given string.

The game supplies a stock title when your character is created. You can also use TITLE
to set your title to something else. Also, for the cost of a restring token, you can
POLITELY ask an available 306-309 immortal to string your title to one you have already
created but that was too long for you to put in with the TITLE command. Please be sure
any title requests are game related.

Sometimes, when the gods are feeling creative, you may even find they've given you a new
one at no charge, but don't ask that it be done for nothing.
~

0 WIMPY~
Syntax: wimpy
Syntax: wimpy <number>

WIMPY sets your wimpy value.  When your character takes damage that reduces
your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically attempt to flee.
You will only flee if your character is not in a wait state -- i.e. has not
been using combat commands like cast, trip and bash, and has not been
tripped or bash by an enemy.

WIMPY with no argument sets your wimpy value to 20% of your maximum hit points.

Some monsters are wimpy.
~

0 OPEN CLOSE LOCK UNLOCK PICK~

~

0 BUY LIST SELL VALUE~
Syntax: buy   <object>
Syntax: list
Syntax: sell  <object>
Syntax: value <object>

BUY buys an object from a shop keeper.
When multiple items of the same name are listed, type 'buy n.item', where n
is the position of the item in a list of that name.  So if there are two
swords, buy 2.sword will buy the second. If you want to buy multiples of
an item, use an * (buy 5*pie will buy 5 pies).  These can be combined into
(for example) buy 2*2.shield, as long as the * is first.

LIST lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.
List <name> shows you only objects of that name.

SELL sells an object to a shop keeper.

VALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.
~

0 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` Sacrifice (NewbInfo)~
Syntax: sacrifice <object>

SACRIFICE offers an object to the gods, who may reward you.
The nature of the reward depends upon the type of object.
~

0 SCROLL~
Syntax: scroll
Syntax: scroll <number>

This command changes the number of lines the mud sends you in a page (the
default is 24 lines).  Change this to a higher number for larger screen
sizes, or to 0 to disabling paging.
~

0 BRANDISH QUAFF RECITE ZAP~
Syntax: brandish
Syntax: quaff    <potion>
Syntax: recite   <scroll> <target>
Syntax: zap      <target>
Syntax: zap

BRANDISH brandishes a magical staff.  QUAFF quaffs a magical potion (as opposed
to DRINK, which drinks mundane liquids).  RECITE recites a magical scroll; the
<target> is optional, depending on the nature of the scroll.  ZAP zaps a
magical wand at a target.  If the target is not specified, and you are fighting
someone, then that character is used for a target.

You must HOLD a wand or a staff before using BRANDISH or ZAP.

All of these commands use up their objects.  Potions and scrolls have a single
charge.  Wands and staves have multiple charges.  When a magical object has no
more charges, it will be consumed.

These commands may require an item skill to be succesful, see the help entries
on the skills scrolls, staves, and wands for more information.
~

0 CONSIDER~
Syntax: consider <character>

CONSIDER tells you what your chances are of killing a character.
Of course, it's only a rough estimate.
~

0 FOLLOW GROUP~
Syntax: follow <character>
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <character>

FOLLOW starts you following another character.  To stop following anyone else,
just FOLLOW <yourself>.

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you. To kick EVERYONE out of
your group, type "nofollow"

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

Grouping can be used to allow a player to kill higher mobs or players.
You may only group within `#10`` Levels of your current level unless 
you are participating in an immortal quest. If you are already in 
a group it is still possible to exceed this hard coded level limit
without being ungrouped automatically and it is your responsibility to 
disband the group in this event.

See also:  NOFOLLOW, GTELL, SPLIT
~

0 VISIBLE~
VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
making you visible again.
~

0 QUIT RENT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: RENT ... not!
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and object.  The game saves your character every
15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving.

Some objects, such as keys and potions, may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game
you will be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

There is no RENT in this mud.  Just SAVE and QUIT whenever you want to leave.
~

0 RECALL /~
Syntax: RECALL

RECALL prays to Mota for miraculous transportation from where you are
back to the Temple of Midgaard.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.  You may
only use the RECALL command until you are past level 30.  Then you must
use the 'WORD OF RECALL' spell.

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for fleeing),
and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for fleeing).  This
chance is based on your recall skill, although a 100% recall does not
insure success.

RECALL costs half of your movement points.

RECALL doesn't work in certain god-forsaken rooms.  Characters afflicted by a
curse may not recall at all.
~

-1 SPLIT~
Syntax: SPLIT <silver> <gold>

SPLIT splits some coins  between you and all the members of your
group who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to SPLIT
the loot after a kill.  The first argument is the amount of silver
the split (0 is acceptable), and the second gold (optional).
Examples:
split 30 	--> split 30 silver
split 20 50	--> split 20 silver, 50 gold
split  0 10	--> split 10 gold
~

0 STEAL~
Syntax: STEAL coins <character>
Syntax: STEAL <object> <character>

STEAL attempts to steal coins or an object from a NPC or coins
from a player character. Both PCs must be PK for one to attempt
to steal from another. Stealing is considered an aggressive action.

In order to STEAL successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

0 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` Practice (NewbInfo)~
Syntax: PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE <skill|spell>

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and spells available to you.  You can check this anywhere.

PRACTICE with an argument practice that skill or spell.  Your learning
percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a some maximum between 80% and 100%,
depending on your class.  You must be at a guild master to practice.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
do use them.

To practice skills and spells with two words in the name, just type practice
followed by both words, without the quotes you'd use to cast them.  Example:
To practice shield block, you would type `!prac shield block``.

See also, `!help gain``.
~

0 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` Train (NewbInfo)~
Syntax: train <str int wis dex con luck hp mana move>
To train the same stat multiple times: train <#>*stat (e.g. train 100*hp)

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
initial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).

It takes one training session to improve an attribute, or to increase
mana or hp by 10.  You receive one session per level.

Train LUCK first, as it gives you more trains per level!
Then the attributes to train next are WIS and CON.  WIS gives you more
practice when you gain a level.  CON gives you more hit points.
In the long run, your character will be most powerful if you train
LUCK then WIS and CON to 18 before practicing or training anything else
~

610 ADVANCE~
Syntax: advance <character> <level>

ADVANCE sets a character's level to the specified value.  It is the
only way to create new immortal characters within the game.  ADVANCE
may also be used to demote characters.
~

610 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
~

608 ALLOW BAN PERMBAN~
Syntax: allow   <site>
	ban     <site> <newbies|all|permit>
	ban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  ALLOW <site> removes a site from
the ban list, if the remover is of equal or higher level than the banner.

A site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players (set
by editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument after the site.
*s may be used to ban either by suffix (*.edu), prefix (labmac*), or
content (*andrews*), but be careful not to accidently lock out too many
sites with a wildcard.  Bans do not save unless the permban command is used.

When banning IPs, use a wildcard for your last digits. (ie 64.216.202.*)
~

610 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~
Syntax: reboot
	shutdown

Reboot shuts down the server.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot.  Be sure to grab all PC
corpses in the game before reboot.  Reboots are announced over music
channel and over gecho, so no one can claim they missed it.

Shutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it.
~

606 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~
Syntax: wizlock
	newlock

Wizlock and newlock both block login attempts to ROM. Wizlock locks
out all non-gods (i.e. level less than 601), except for link-dead players who
are returning.  Newlock only locks out new character generation, typically
used for preventing a spammer from returning.  Wizlocking should be avoided,
and newlocking should be accompanied by mail or a note to the imps.

A god must be at least Supreme level to wizlock the game.
~

608 DENY~
Syntax: deny <name>

Deny locks a character out of a game permanently, rendering their character
name unusable.  It may only be removed by editing the file, for this reason
freeze is usually preferred.
~

607 DISCONNECT~
Syntax: disconnect <name>

Disconnect breaks a player's link to the game, dumping them back to the telnet
prompt.  This is a non-lethal way of getting rid of spammers and annoying
players.
~

306 FREEZE~
Syntax: freeze <name>

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a
troublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command.
~

603 FORCE~
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command, except of course delete.

Below level 307 (Deity) force can only be used on mobiles, and force all is
unavailable.  You also cannot 'force orc murder hugo', for example.

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.
~

605 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` SOCKETS (ImmInfo)~
Syntax: sockets
	sockets <name>

SOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including
users in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the
channel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in
merc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.

The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used
to identify switched gods (i.e. socket orc shows the name of anyone switched
into an orc).
~

606 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` LOAD How_to_load_mobs_and_objects (ImmInfo)~
Syntax: load mob <vnum>
	load obj <vnum> <level>

The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to
duplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with the vnum
command, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.

Load puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are
put in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the god. Old
format objects must be given a level argument to determine their power, new
format objects have a preset level that cannot be changed without set.
(see also clone, vnum, stat)
~

609 SET~
Syntax: set mob   <mobile> <field> <value>
	set obj   <object> <field> <value>
	set room  <number> <field> <value>
	set skill <char>   <name>  <rating>
	set skill <char>   all     <rating>

The set command is used to change the numerical values of the various data
structures. Type set <class> without an argument to see a listing of options.
Set skill all (pc's only) will set all the character's skills to the value
given.  Use string to change the strings on an object or mobile.
(see also string, stat)
~

605 NOCHANNEL NOEMOTE NOSHOUT NOTELL~
Syntax: nochannel <character>
	noemote   <character>
	noshout   <character>
.   Nowish     <Character>
	notell    <character>

Noemote, noshout, and notell are used to muffle other characters, by
preventing them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively.
Characters who are noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those
forms of communication.

The nochannel command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim
from using any of the channels (gossip, cgossip, Q/A, music) on the game.
Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming on public channels.
~

607 PARDON~
Syntax: pardon <character> killer
	pardon <character> thief

Pardon pardons a player for their crimes.  Don't pardon a player unless you
are sure they deserve it.  Being killed by Hassan acts as an automatic
pardon.
~

605 PURGE~
Syntax: purge
	purge <character>

Purge is used to clean up the world.  Purge with no arguments removes all the
NPC's and objects in the current room.  Purge with an argument purges one
character from anywhere in the world.

Purge will not get rid of PC's, or objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE flag
set (i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers, Hassan).  Mobiles may be
purged if they are called directly by name.

`!DO NOT PURGE LINKDEAD CHARACTERS!!!``  Force them to quit.
~

608 RESTORE~
Syntax: restore <character>
	restore room
	restore all

Restore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character.  It also heals poison, plague, and blindness.

Restore room (or restore with no argument) performs a restore on every player
in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players. Restore all
is only usable by creators and implementors.  Restore should be used sparingly
or not at all.
~

607 SLAY~
Syntax: slay <character>

Slay kills a character in cold blood, no saving throw.  Best not to use this
command on players if you enjoy being a god.
~

602 TRANSFER~
Syntax: transfer <character>
	transfer all
	transfer <character> <location>
	transfer all         <location>
   transfer questors

Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all
should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have
horrible effects on slow links. Teleport is a synonym for transfer.  Trans
questors will trans every character with a questflag to you.
~

604 AT AT_IMM_COMMAND~
Syntax: at <location> <command>
        at random room <command>
        at random mob <command>
        at random char <command>

At executes the given command (which may have arguments) at the given
location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
a mobile, or as the name of an object.

At works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back (if the command didn't change your
location).

Using the "random" argument selects a random target of the specified
type. If mob or char is selected, the command can have "@" which will
expand to the name of the mob.

Examples:
        at burns slap burns           at Mr. Burns, Slap Mr. Burns
        at random room drop token     drops a token in a random room
        at random mob give token @    gives a token to a random mob
        at random char give token @   gives a token to a random player

~

605 ECHO GECHO PECHO~
Syntax: echo  <message>
	gecho <message>
	pecho <character> <message>

These commands all perform similar functions.  Echo sends the message to
all characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent
it.  Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho
sends the message to the player specified as the target.  Any higher-level
god will see a prompt in front of your message, informing him or her that it
is an echo.
~

602 GOTO~
Syntax: goto <location>

Goto takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile, or as the name of an object.

You may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present. Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain
god level.

Implementors can use the violate command to get into private rooms.
~

602 HOLYLIGHT INVIS WIZINVIS~
Syntax: holylight
	wiznvis <level>

Holylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will mke you invisible to all players of
a lower level than your invisibility level.  It defaults to the maximum
(your level) if no argument is given.  Wizi 310 characters are totally
invisible.
~

602 INCOGNITO~
Toggling your incognito status will hide your presence from people outside the
room you are in, but leave you visible to those who are with you.  It takes
a level argument similar to wizinvis, people at that level or higher can see
you regarless of location.
~

602 MEMORY~
Syntax: memory

Memory reports the size of your mud.

The 'Mobs' and 'Objs' lines report the number of types of mobiles and objects,
not the number of instances currently in the game.

The 'Strings' line shows memory used by area-file strings.  These strings have
a maximum limit, which is also shown.

The 'Perms' line shows permanently allocated memory blocks.  There is no limit
on the number and size of these blocks.
~

606 VNUM OVNUM MVNUM~
Syntax: ovnum <obj>
	mvnum <mob>
        ovnum <arg> <arg>
        mvnum <arg> <arg>
        ovnum list
        mvnum list

OVNUM shows all objects with that name and their vnum.  MVNUM shows all
the mobs with that name and their vnum.  VNUM doesn't work any more, try
making an alias for it.  MVNUM LIST and OVNUM LIST shows the different
searchable options for the command.  OVNUM TYPE LIGHT shows all the vnums
of all the objects that are lights.
~

302 STAT~
Syntax: stat <name>
	stat mob  <name>
	stat obj  <name>
	stat room <number>

The stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room
within the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return a object
(if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room
(if a number is  given).  Stat room with no argument stats the room you are
standing in.  Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto.
(see also goto, transfer)
~

602 MWHERE OWHERE~
Syntax: mwhere <arg> <arg>
        owhere <arg> <arg>
        mwhere list
        owhere list

Mwhere shows you the locations of all mobiles with a particular name.
Owhere does the same for objects.  Typing mwhere list and owhere list show
the different arguments you can use for searching for a mob or object.
~

605 PEACE~
Syntax: peace

Peace causes all characters in a room to stop fighting. It also strips the
AGGRESSIVE bit from mobiles.
~

602 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` POOFIN POOFOUT (ImmInfo)~
Syntax: poofin  <message>
Syntax: pooffout <message>

The standard messages for goto are 'arrives in a swirling mist' and
'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of
your own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.  These messages
must include your name somewhere in the string.

Poofin and poofout only show to characters who can see you.
(see also goto)
~

609 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` PROTECT No_snooping (ImmInfo)~
Syntax: protect <character>

Log <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle.
Logs may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be accompanied
by mail to the implementors.

Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

Log all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell the imps.

Lots and Properties
---------------------
Properties looks like this:

[Property] Lot: Number  'Name of Property'

First of all, I'd like to make it clear that you aren't actually
buying an area or a physical room in the game.  When you own a
property, you earn points.

`!- How do I buy a property?``
Many ways--auction notes, real-time auctions, quests, picking one up like
a hidden token, etc.  While most are a spur-of-the-moment thing, some are
scheduled, like quests. You CANNOT, however, buy a property just by asking
Evangelion.  It just doesn't work that way.

`!- How are points accrued?``
Every Sunday is a 'round'.  Each 'round' is like a season, your
crops grow, you sell your crops, you get money, etc.

`!- What are the points?``
Each point is worth 1 property token.  Keep in mind that this game
isn't going to be ending anytime soon, so it'll keep accumulating
points, Sunday after Sunday after Sunday.  In addition, the owner
with the most points at certain stages will be awarded for
winning and will be given nice prizes!

There are two ways to become PK if you aren't already.  Since most clans
require you to be PK, you're probably here because you're interested in
being clanned. 

If you are  below or at level 300, simply type go_pk with no arguments.  The
game will prompt you to enter go_pk a second time with no arguments to
convert to a PK character, or type it with an argument if you've changed
your mind. 

If you're between levels 150 and 300, you'll require immortal
intervention to become PK.  Simply contact the leader of the clan you
wish to join, or any level 309 or 310 immortal, and notify them them that
you wish to be made PK for clanning.  Please provide proof that you are
indeed seeking a clan.  We will not make just anyone PK, especially folks
who've leveled to 300 and suddenly, now that they're buff, want to be
player killers.  This is for folks who're being clanned only! 

Thank you, The Staff

`#Auction bid `&+`#XX``:         Where `#XX`` is a number, this increases the current bid by the
`7                         percentage represented by `#XX`` (minimum of `#10%``).
`#Auction `!stop``:            `&(`OImmortal only`&)`` This will stop a currently running auction and
`7                         confiscate the item.
`#Auction ``<`#item``> <`##``> <`#Token_type``> This allows you to auction an item for different types 
``                         of tokens as payment.

`!DO NOT AUCTION FIREBLADES!!!`` (they have a time limit and could crash the mud).
Also, please do not auction things like hits of acid, pieces of shit, or other very
common items.  It is in poor taste and no one really wants to see it.  It is also
possible grounds for penalization.

0 GROUP~
This command allows you to join people or unjoin people to your group.  When
you are grouped you may share in the amount of experience you recieve from
different mobs you fight.  You also may split gold within the group and most
area affects dont affect your group that are normally attack based.  You also
see limited stats of the players in your group. To see who is in your group you
can either type GR or GROUP.

Syntax: Group <target players name> To group or ungroup.

In order to group someone they must be following you.

0 KILL~
The kill command allows you to either kill a mob or player. This command
is pretty self explanatory.

It was then converted to work with Envy by Jason Dinkel, and ported to ROM
2.3 by Hans Birkeland (Hugin). Port to Rom 2.4 by Ivan Toledo (ver 1.7).

     Inside an editor, typing COMMANDS lists working commands and ? gives
help. AEDIT and REDIT default to the current area or room. EDIT ROOM RESET
resets the current room.  Most commands with no arguments display syntax.

Diff = max - min.  Mean is the arithmetic mean.
The values in parenthesis are the the standard merc values.
~

602 MANADICE~
A high number of dice makes for less variance in mobiles mana.
The values the server generates for merc-type mobs is

  <level> d 10 + 100

where level is the level of the mobile.
~

602 DAMDICE~
A high number of dice makes for less variance in mobiles hitpoints.
Suggested values are:

       Level      dice       min      min    mean
        1         1d2+0       1        2       2

602 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` RESETS (BuildingImmInfo)~
Syntax:
RESET <number> M <mob vnum> <max world> <max room>
RESET <number> O <obj vnum>                          -loads object to room
RESET <number> P <obj vnum> <max world> <into object vnum> <number to load>
RESET <number> G <obj vnum> <max world>
RESET <number> E <obj vnum> <max world> <wield location>
RESET <number> DELETE                           - delete a reset

RESET alone will display the resets in the current room.  The <number> will
be displayed with this list.  Typing ? WEAR-LOC will list possible locations
that an object can be loaded to.  The [<max #>] is the maximum number of
mobiles allowed in this room and will default to 1 if no number is entered.

For resets to be successful make sure that you add them in a logical order.
For example if you are equiping a mobile don't load a container in the room
and fill it with some objects and then continue equiping the mobile.  It is
likely that resets will backfire if they are not carefully entered.

If you wish to reset the room then use EDIT ROOM RESET.
 
`!Please be CAREFUL when resetting things. Incorrect resets can crash the mud.``

-1 STRING_EDITOR~
`#String Editor Commands``:
``  `1.`!r`` 'old' 'new'         - replace a substring
``                           (requires '' or "" around strings)
``  `1.`!s``                     - show string so far
``  `1.`!f``                     - (word wrap) string
``  `1.`!c``                     - clear string so far
``  `1.`!ld`` <number>           - delete line number <num>
``  `1.`!li`` <number> <string>  - insert <str> at line <num>
``  `1.`!lr`` <number> <string>  - replace line <num> with <str>
``  `1.`!x``                     - exit the string editor
``  `@@``                      - exit the string editing

The string editor is a simple tool used to edit long strings.  While in
the editor, new text is added simply by typing it in.  The commands allow
you to controll extra formatting for a text string.  All commands must be
typed on at the beginning of a blank line and must be the only command on
that line.

~

0 Restring 'Mort Restring"~
The restring command will allow you to change the names of your
equiment for any Restring token you have.  It works somewhat like
the immortal string command.

The syntax is:

`6 restring show `^[character]`` - shows you (or the optional character)
``                             the string so far.
`7 `6restring codes `^[character]`7  exactly like restring show, except it
`7                             shows the color codes.
`6 restring clone `^<object>``   - clones the string of an object.
`6 restring clear``            - clears the strings you are working on.
`6 restring name `^<string>``    - sets the name of the object.
`6 restring short `^<string>``   - sets the short description of the object.
`6 restring long `^<string>``    - sets the long description of the object.
`6 restring set `^<object>``     - sets the strings on the chosen object and
``                             consumes ones restring token.

The `^name`` of the object is the keywords used to get the object such
as '`#sword``' or '`#lamp``'.  It is not advisable for you to put color
codes in the name as it will just make it harder for you to do anything
with the item.

The `^short description`` is what shows up in your inventory or when
you are wearing the item.

The `^long description`` is shown when the item is laying on the ground.

The ability to restring your own items is a PRIVILEDGE.
`!DO NOT`` abuse it.  There are a couple of initial rules
that you should follow:

`#  1.`` Do not use unecessary profanity.
`#  2.`` Do NOT use prejudicial slurs.
`#  3.`` Do not create spammy strings. Especially for weapons.
`#  4.`` Do NOT use the beep color code.
`#  5.`` Avoid the use of the line break color code.

If you ignore these rules, your item will be confiscated.
If the offense is bad enough or repeated, you WILL be `!FRIED``.

0 master_skills~
Master skills are level 300 skills/spells that can *only* be obtained
through a Daigen Hatin's.  There is one for each class - each of them are
designed to be the height of its corresponding profession.  The skills
are

Warrior  -  Carnage  (see 'help carnage')
Cleric   -  Retribution  (see 'help retribution')
Thief    -  Displace (see 'help displace')
Mage     -  Raze (see 'help raze')
Witch    -  Leech (see 'help leech')

 
`!*`1*`!*`1NOTE`!*`1*`!*``
These skills are not meant to be a crutch for beating areas.
~

0 carnage~
Carnage is designed as a group-fighting technique for warriors.  It
does about half of maximum damage but it hits every player that the
warrior is fighting instead of just the first one. It is a continual
effect built into the normal attack round that is not consciously
controlled by the player. Each use of the skill will make the warrior
stronger for a very limited time increasing their damroll, hitroll, and
saves. The power level of the skill grows for each person that the
warrior is fighting against.
`^Example``: If the player is fighting 10 people the damage will be
noticeably higher than if they are fighting 1 or 2.
~

0 retribution~
Retribution is a damage prevention affect much like Druid Call or Sanctuary.
It reduces damage dealt to the affected user by 25 and redirects that
damage back at the inflictor.  If a damage source would deal 1000 hp worth
of damage, instead it will deal 750 hp damage and redirect 250 hp back at
the person dealing it.  Note: The damage will not be redirected if the
inflictor is not in the room so area affects and spells cast through voodoo
reduce the damage, but do not redirect it.  Retribution costs 750 mana and
lasts 20 ticks.

~

0 displace~
Displace is designed as a long-range assassination technique.  Through the
use of the skill, the Thief can attack any person that they can scan.  If a
valid target is found, it moves the Thief from the room they are currently
in to the room of the victim and initiates combat through an
Assassinate-like attack which does slightly more damage than Assassinate.
On a successfull hit, there is a chance of Blinding and Fearing the victim.
Farsight, becasue it affects scan range, effectively increases the range of
the skill.

~

0 raze~
Raze is a hybrid spell that is part effect and part area spell.  When the
caster affects him/herself with Raze, they will be surrounded by a vicious
aura that causes the earth to erupt in the current room and 3 rooms in each
direction hitting every person in those rooms.  The affect only lasts a
total of 12 combat rounds but it does damage each of those round regardless
of whether or not the mage is fighting.  There is a mana-price associated
with maintaining the affect.  The affect does increasingly more damage each
combat round and consumes progressively more mana.  Raze only costs 250 mana
to cast, but each round costs the mage increasingly more mana.  The affect
can be cancelled by successfully casting the spell a second time.

~

0 leech~
Leech is designed as a more effective version of Energy Drain.  It does
damage to the victim in a range between Demonfire and Psychic Headbutt.  25%
of the damage inflicted is restored to the casters HP.  The spell
additionally inflicts 300 mana damage (600 points if they fail to save vs.
spells) that mana is returned to the caster of the spell.  Leech costs 450
mana per casting.

-1 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` splitting_tokens splittingtokens (NewbInfo)~
`!Splitting tokens onto more than one object``

How do you split tokens? Here are a few examples:

You have boots with -200 mana, and some armor with -200 hpts.  You love
the other stats, just hate being penalized.  Split a 200 hitpoint/200 mana
token.  This gives the boots 200 mana, and the armor 200 hpts.  Evening
them both out to 0.  If you have 2 tokens, you could split both the tokens
(or, to look at it differently, one full token in each).  If you do that, then
you end up with +200 mana on the boots, and +200 hpts on the armor.

You can split 10/10, 20/20, 200/200, 400/400, 500/500/500, Saves or AC tokens.
There is no limit on the amount of objects you can split it on, but please
don't make Imms put 1 hit point on 400 different objects.

Tip about splitting tokens: Don't split the IMP tokens unless you have to.
Even if an object is -1000 mana, it will probably be easier within the game
to obtain 5 200/200 tokens than 1 500/500 token.  Don't use these special
ones unless you feel like you have to. Personally, I think a 500/500 token
is worth *10 times* what any 200/200 token, even though (mathematically)
it only gives a little over 2X the affect (1000 total, vs 400 total).

The same thing goes for splitting on any type of token.  hp/mana, AC,
hitroll/damroll, Saves. Make sure you do the math before you do any
splitting.  Make sure you know which objects are best for you, and what
are actually *worth* putting tokens into. It's a bad idea to token low level
eq unless you plan to stay at a low level, otherwise when you hit high level
you'll wish you had those tokens for your higher level gear.

-1 zodiac~
Tseng  used to have this really cool collection of zodiac coins. Tseng
loved them. He carried them with him wherever he went. Then, one day,
Tseng was running from the cops (don't ask) and he somehow developed a
hole in his pocket and he lost his collection! You need to help Tseng
find them!

OK how it really works, is that Tseng periodically drops a full set of
zodiac coins, 12 of them, one for each sign of the zodiac
(`!Taurus``, `!Gemini``, `!Cancer``, `OLeo``, `OVirgo``, `OLibra``, `PScorpio``, `PSaggitarius``, `PCapricorn``,
`^Aquarius``, `^Pisces``, `^Aries``.) He also drops a collection bag that looks
like this: `8a Z``o`&di``a`8c c``o`&l``l`8e``c`&t``io`8n`` b`&a```8g``.

If you find the whole set, and the bag, simply return them to Tseng and
he will hook you up with a nice prize bag.

Simple no?

-1 rom~
ROM started in early February 1993, using Merc 1.0 code. In July of 1993,
ROM II was started, eventually replacing the original ROM.  ROM was up for
a little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3) was released,
and various other ROM muds were started, including Rivers of Mud under
a new management (Zump's ROM), at rom.org 9000.
Alander's current project is Athen, the sequel to the ROM code.
It will be found at hypercube.org 6666, when it is opened.
The following people contributed to the ROM flavor of the merc base code:
Socials --
    Kelsey and Liralen
New, Improved Valhalla --
    Liralen
Puff's new special proc and improved poofin/poofout code --
    Seth
Maps and map shop --
    Ezra, Regnan (Olympus)


Nirvana zone --
    Forstall (mobiles rewritten by Alander)
Mob Factory --
    Pinkfloyd (originally written for ROM, mobiles rewritten by Alander)
Geographically correct Midgaard (tm) --
    Alander
Ideas and playtesting --
    Thousands of dedicated mudders around the world
Beta testing --
    Ken Blosser, Doug Araya, and Sherene Neil all helped with bug reports
    and suggestions, saving a lot of headaches
New Thalos area was donated by Onivel of Jedi, who was also the originator
of the ASCII flags used in the zone files
ROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead mud, and the release

shares many of the features I wrote while I was there.  Additional code
was written by Seth Scott (enchant armor, the new poofin/poofout), and
many
contributions and ideas from the Merc list were used.  Portions of Rusty's
code from Moosehead also remain.
The new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with
Gabrielle Taylor and Brian Moore, without whom this release wouldn't
have happened.  In particular, the new privacy code, furniture, and
wiznet are largely the results of Gabrielle's ideas.
Changes to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the changes
to Merc 2.1 source code, were done by Alander over many a late night of
hair-pulling. Hope you enjoy it.

Each week the `Ocards`` will change and I expect everyone to turn in `Ocards``
from previous weeks even if you didn't find 5. They will all be flagged

for all stats.. hp mana hit dam move and so on. 
to enchant saves and ac.. you need to add enchant neck ac -1000   saves -40...
you don't need to add the - to disenchant items... only when enchanting them
 
for flags on items.. like burnproof... flag obj neck extra burnproof will add the flag
if the item alread has the flag burnproof and you want to remove the flag 
you would flag obj neck extra burnproof.. will remove the flag just like adding it.
same goes for the glowing humming.. to remove those same thing flag obj neck extra hum 
 
for weaponflags... enchant obj neck weapon_flag and so on you get the picture. on that I hope

-1 word using_tokens~
This help file is to explain how you use all the special tokens currently
available, it will cover every type of unique token, and every possible
use of them.  To start with, the normal maximum limit for enchanting
objects is +1000 `0hpts`7/`2mana`7/`3movement`7, +50 `1hitroll`7/`5damroll`7, -40 `^saves`7,
-1000 `6AC`7 and a total of 25 to each stat.  This applies to all tokens,
regardless of value.  
 
`#200`7/`#200`7 hitpoints, mana or move 
You use this token on objects that are below the legal maximum for
hitpoints and/or mana/movement.  All you really do is find an IMM to
redeem it, choose an item you can use it on, and then tell the `PIMM`7 after
they trans you.  Give them the object, and they'll fix it up.  You can
use it all into HP's or all into MANA as long as it does not surpass the
`!legal limit`7 of +1000 hpts, +1000 mana, and +1000 moves.  Example: a -400
mana object, you can use your `#200`7/`#200`7 token to give it +400 mana,
balancing it at 0.  Only 30`@9`7's+ can redeem this token.  See help
splitting`@_`7tokens about splitting this type of token on more than 1 item
 
`@10`7/`@10`7 hitroll/damroll  You use this token on
objects that below the legal limit for `1hitroll`7 and/or `5damroll`7.  All you
really do is find an `PIMM`7 to redeem it, choose an item you can use it on
`!legally`7, and then tell the `PIMM`7 after they trans you.  Give them the
object, and they'll fix it up.  You can use it all into HITROLL or all
into DAMROLL as long as it does not surpass the legal limit of +50
`1hitroll`7, +50 `5damroll`7.  Example: a -20 damroll object, you can use your
`@10`7/`@10`7 token to give it +20 damroll, balancing it at 0.  Only 30`@9`7's+ can
redeem this token.  See help splitting_tokens about splitting this type
of token on more than 1 item
 
-250 `^AC`7 token You use this token on objects that are below the legal
limit for AC.  All you really do is find an `PIMM`7 to redeem it, choose an
item you can use it on legally, and then tell the IMM after they trans
you.  Give them the object, and they'll fix it up.  You can use it all
into AC as long as it does not surpass the legal limit of -1000 AC. 
`!Example:`7 a +250 `^AC`7 object - you can use your AC token to give it -250 `^AC`7,
balancing it at 0.  See help splitting_tokens about splitting this type
of token on more than 1 item.  Only 30`@9`7's+ can redeem this token.  
 
-40 `&saves`7 tokens  Only 30`@9`7's+ can redeem this
token.  It only comes from the IMPS in their luvin/hatins.  It is usable
on any object that does not already have more than -40 saves on it.  See
help splitting_tokens about splitting this type of token on more than 1 item.
 
12 points added to an imm luvin item (Only in Immluvins) Okay. 
Read help luvin.  Now read help luvinstats.  See the "12 point" system
When you redeem an IMM luvin with option 1, you get 2 items (12 points to
spend each).  That's where these tokens come in.  You can use a maximum
of (ONE ADDITION 12 POINT TOKEN) per object.  It used to be 2 each, but
that was before we toned down eq.  This means: with 2 tokens, and 150 imm
wilds. You can spend 24 points on each object, instead of 12 on each. 
This makes for some pretty nifty & unique eq.  Asided from it not
granting perm affects, some ImmLuvin eq with the extra 12 points even
rivals `##Velveeta`7 eq!  Any 30`@9`7+ can redeem this token with their luvin
 
`!Ra`&ce chan`!ges`7 Any 309+ may redeem this token.  Simply tell the `PIMM`7 who
takes your token which race you want to be, and they will set it for
you.  You will lose access to all race skills that require activation to
be used.  Examples: Rake, Shriek, Veil.  However, there are some nice
combos you can do with a couple races that don't require an activated
ability.  If you don't know which or how yet, study.  :) I can think of
at least 3 different ways to abuse this token.  When your race changes,
you keep your HP/mana/moves but your stats are adjusted to your new
race's max stats.  
 
`&Cl`!ass chan`&ges `7Any 30`@9`7+ may redeem this token.  Simply tell the IMM who
takes your token which class you want to be, and they will set it for
you.  You will not "lose" any of your skills/spells percentages(%'s), BUT
if the class you change to does not let you use it (Example: going from
mage to cleric, cleric does not have the 'combat group') then it won't
even show up on your list.  It's still there, but you just can't use it. 
 (Unless you class change back again later) So be careful if you class
change, make sure you have enough spare trains to gain all the new stuff
you'll want.  This is a sub-par token, not really worth that much except
for a few people, primarily those who wished they had a different
character.  That is why race change/class changes exist.  It's easier to
redeem a token & play around with a new race/class than spend hours
leveling it just to find out you like your other character better.  When
your class changes, you keep your HP/mana/moves and any skills/spells
that your new class would get, but skills and spells specific to your old
class that your new class doesn't natively have available to it are
lost.  Special Note: If your character has used a Master Skill Token (see
below) and you decide to use a class change token on it, you WILL be
unable to use the master skill for the old class and will have to gain a
new one for your new class.  
 
`PTrain`7 tokens Train tokens are edible.  The basic train token is worth 5,
but immortals may set the value higher, depending on the prize.  When you
*eat* a train token, it adds the trains to your current total of trains
 
`3Qu`#e`3st`#P`3oint `7(`#QP`7) tokens Questpoint tokens are edible.  They come in
various denominations.  When you *eat* a questpoint token, it adds the
quest points to your current total of quest points.  
 
`&Restring`7 tokens Restring tokens can be used to restring your equipment. 
See 'help mortal_restring' for information on proper use.  
 
`OWeapon flag`7 tokens Type "help weapon_flag" that is a list of each weapon
flag. Read "help blacksmith_weapons" for info on most, the others are:
vorpal, sharp, and acidic.  Vorpal gives a 1 in 5000 chance every hit of
instant decapitation.  Sharp makes your weapon do 150% it's normal damage
 (considered the best weapon flag by most).  And the acidic weapon flag
does a little extra damage each hit, can pop potions, ruin the AC on eq
by "pitting and etching" it, as well as burn things sometimes (cause them
to melt).  Immortals will only add weapon flags that you cannot buy from
the `8blacksmith`7.  You can also use weapon flags to remove or add extra
flags on any object.  Example: your backpack is burnproof.  You want it
`!burnproof`7 nodrop nouncurse (so you can type 'drop all' and not drop it,
still, and not have to worry about it uncursing ever) - It already has
burnproof, all you need are 2 weapon flags - and you're set.  For a list
of extra flags, read "help extra".  Any level 30`#8`7+ may redeem this token

610 `^[`#I`!n`#F`!o`^]`` SEDIT_SPECIAL_CHARS (ImpInfo)~
Seeing as how '`&sedit``' is a little confusing, the following is the
list of special characters that you can use within the display
strings for the social you are editing:
 
`@    $n`8:`` name of person doing the social
`@    $N`8:`` name of person targetted by the social
 
`@    $e`8:`` he/she/it of person doing the social
`@    $E`8:`` he/she/it of person targetted by the social
 
`@    $m`8:`` him/her/it of person doing the social
`@    $M`8:`` him/her/it of person targetted by the social
 
`@    $s`8:`` his/her/its of person doing the social
`@    $S`8:`` his/her/its of person targetted by the social
 
Type '`Psedit show smile``' for an example.

610 pload punload~
Syntax: pload <pfile name>
``        load char <pfile name>
``        punload <pfile name>

pLoad is an `PIMP`` only command that will load a pfile into the game.
When loaded, the character (and their pet, if they have one) will
appear in the room with you, allowing you to manipulate them in the
same way as if they were logged in.  They will not show up on any
of the who lists.
 
When you are finished, pUnload will return the character (and their
pet) back to the room they came from, and log them out.
 
`!NOTE:`` Unfortunately, there are two small bugs currently being worked
on - firstly, when you pUnload the character, if there is anyone in
the room they are being returned to, those people will see the
character's quit message...  secondly, the character will be able to
"reconnect" to their loaded pfile if they try to log into the game
while you're working with them.

THERE ARE NO SPECIAL CASES!

0 changes_soon_to_come~
In the near future there will be jokes that will actually be funny.
~

0 TSCRATCH SCRATCHOFF~
Syntax: tscratch <scratchoff ticket>
 
If you happen to run across one of the scratch-off lottery tickets throughout
the game, you can use the tscratch command much like you would use a small coin
to rub off the top layer of the ticket to see your numbers underneath and see if
you are a winner.
 
There are a few different types of tickets out there, and the prizes range from
questpoints, to immtokens, to some of the special tokens, too.  If you win, the
prize is automatically handed to you, so there is no need to find an Immortal
to redeem the ticket - the ticket is automatically destroyed once it is useless.
~

610 MAKECARD~
Syntax: `&makecard``
`&        makecard <`8type`&>``
 
Use this comand to create a scratchcard (see '`^HELP SCRATCHOFF``').  Using the
first syntax, with no type specified, a random type will be created.  If you
wish to make a specific type of card, use its type number, seen below:
 
`&Game Type 1``
`8  Name: `!H`1o`!t `@50``
`8  Odds: ``1 in 4
`8  Rules:`` Match your lucky number (Seen on card) with any one of the six
``         numbers on the card to win the shown prize.
`8  Prizes: `` QP (5-45), or 1-3 of any type of token seen in "`^tstat <char>``",
``           or 1-3 trains.
